  Design tokens and examples for customizing paragraph spacing, alignment, and typography in Stencila themes.
---

# Usage

Start with these tokens when customizing paragraphs:

- `--paragraph-spacing` to align spacing with your document rhythm
- `--paragraph-line-height` to tune reading density
- `--paragraph-text-align` and `--paragraph-text-indent` for layout style
- `--paragraph-lead-font-size` and `--paragraph-lead-font-weight` for opening paragraphs
- `--paragraph-hyphens` and `--paragraph-text-wrap` for text flow

Lead paragraphs (first after headings) use the lead tokens automatically, and paragraph spacing derives from `--content-spacing` for responsive rhythm.

# Tokens

## Spacing and Typography Tokens

Paragraph-specific controls for spacing, typography, alignment, and text flow.

| Token                     | Description                                     | Default Value             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `--paragraph-spacing`     | Paragraph spacing (responsive)                  | `var(--content-spacing)`  |
| `--paragraph-line-height` | Line height within paragraphs                   | `var(--text-line-height)` |
| `--paragraph-text-align`  | Text alignment (left, right, center, justify)   | `left`                    |
| `--paragraph-text-indent` | First-line indentation                          | `0`                       |
| `--paragraph-hyphens`     | Hyphenation control (none, auto, manual)        | `none`                    |
| `--paragraph-orphans`     | Minimum lines at bottom of page/column break    | `3`                       |
| `--paragraph-widows`      | Minimum lines at top of page/column break       | `3`                       |
| `--paragraph-text-wrap`   | Text wrapping algorithm (auto, pretty, balance) | `auto`                    |

## Lead Paragraph Tokens

Special styling for the first paragraph after headings.

| Token                          | Description                                | Default Value |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `--paragraph-lead-font-size`   | Font size for lead paragraphs              | `inherit`     |
| `--paragraph-lead-font-weight` | Font weight for lead paragraphs            | `inherit`     |
| `--paragraph-lead-text-indent` | First-line indent for lead paragraphs      | `0`           |
# Examples

## Default Paragraphs

Standard paragraph styling with automatic responsive spacing and typography:

```css
:root {
  /* No design token overrides */
}
```

::: style

This is a default paragraph that demonstrates the base typography and spacing. Paragraphs automatically inherit responsive spacing from the content system, scaling appropriately across different screen sizes without explicit customization.

The line height, font family, and colors all use semantic tokens that provide automatic dark mode support. This gives you a solid foundation that works well across different contexts and user preferences.

## Research Paper Style

Traditional scholarly document with justified text and paragraph indentation:

```css
:root {
  --paragraph-text-align: justify;
  --paragraph-text-indent: 1.5em;
  --paragraph-hyphens: auto;
}
```

::: style --paragraph-text-align: justify; --paragraph-text-indent: 1.5em; --paragraph-hyphens: auto;

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Participants were recruited from three research institutions across North America between January 2023 and March 2024.

The primary endpoint was computational efficiency measured in operations per second. Secondary endpoints included memory usage, error rates, and user satisfaction scores collected via standardized questionnaires.

Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.3.0. All tests were two-tailed with significance set at p < 0.05. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation techniques.

## Scientific Journal

Professional layout with lead paragraphs and enhanced typography:

```css
:root {
  --paragraph-text-align: justify;
  --paragraph-hyphens: auto;
  --paragraph-lead-font-size: var(--font-size-lg);
  --paragraph-lead-font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium);
  --paragraph-orphans: 3;
  --paragraph-widows: 3;
}
```

::: style --paragraph-text-align: justify; --paragraph-hyphens: auto; --paragraph-lead-font-size: var(--font-size-lg); --paragraph-lead-font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium); --paragraph-orphans: 3; --paragraph-widows: 3;

### Abstract

Machine learning algorithms have shown promising results in predicting protein folding structures, but computational complexity remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption in clinical settings.

This study presents a novel approach combining transformer architectures with physics-based constraints to achieve 95% accuracy while reducing computational time by 60% compared to existing methods.

Our results demonstrate that hybrid models can bridge the gap between theoretical precision and practical implementation, opening new possibilities for real-time protein structure prediction in drug discovery pipelines.

## Thesis Chapter

Generous spacing for long-form scholarly reading:

```css
:root {
  --paragraph-spacing: var(--space-10);
  --paragraph-text-align: left;
  --paragraph-line-height: var(--line-height-md);
  --paragraph-text-wrap: pretty;
}
```

::: style --paragraph-spacing: var(--space-10); --paragraph-text-align: left; --paragraph-line-height: var(--line-height-md); --paragraph-text-wrap: pretty;

The field of computational biology has witnessed remarkable advances in the past decade, driven largely by the availability of large datasets and improved algorithmic approaches. Early work by Smith et al. (2018) laid the foundation for sequence-based prediction methods.

Subsequent research has focused on integrating multiple data modalities, including structural information, evolutionary relationships, and functional annotations. The breakthrough came with the introduction of attention mechanisms, which allowed models to capture long-range dependencies in protein sequences.

# Tips

**Hanging indents**: Use `--paragraph-text-indent` when you want classic scholarly formatting.

**Justified text**: Pair `--paragraph-text-align: justify` with `--paragraph-hyphens: auto` for cleaner spacing.

**Line breaking**: Use `--paragraph-text-wrap: pretty` where supported to improve rag control.
