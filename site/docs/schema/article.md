title: Article
description: An article, including news and scholarly articles.

This is an implementation, and extension, of schema.org [`Article`](https://schema.org/Article).
It extends schema.org `Article` by adding a `content` property which must be
an array of [`Block`](./Block), as well as the properties added by
[`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork) which it extends.


# Properties

The `Article` type has these properties:

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                             | Type                                                                              | Inherited from                       | `JSON-LD @id`                                                | Aliases                                                                                                                   |

# Bindings

The `Article` type is represented in:

- [JSON-LD](https://stencila.org/Article.jsonld)
- [JSON Schema](https://stencila.org/Article.schema.json)
- Python class [`Article`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/blob/main/python/python/stencila/types/article.py)
- Rust struct [`Article`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/blob/main/rust/schema/src/types/article.rs)
- TypeScript class [`Article`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/blob/main/ts/src/types/Article.ts)

# Testing

During property-based (a.k.a generative) testing, the properties of the `Article` type are generated using the following strategies[^1] for each complexity level. Any optional properties that are not in this table are set to `None`.

| Property  | Complexity | Description                                | Strategy        |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `content` | Min+       | Generate a single arbitrary block node     | `vec_blocks(1)` |
|           | Low+       | Generate up to two arbitrary block nodes   | `vec_blocks(2)` |
|           | High+      | Generate up to four arbitrary block nodes  | `vec_blocks(4)` |
|           | Max        | Generate up to eight arbitrary block nodes | `vec_blocks(8)` |
