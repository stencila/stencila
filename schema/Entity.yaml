  This type exists mainly to have a more simple base class than schema.org's `Thing`.
  This schema includes special properties that are analogous to JSON-LDs `@type` and `@id`.
required:
  - type
core:
  - id
properties:
  type:
    '@id': schema:type
    description: The type of this item

      This is a special property analogous to JSON-LD's `@type` keyword.
    type: string
  id:
    '@id': schema:id
    description: The identifier for this item

    strip:
      - id
    html:
      attr: id
    type: string
