      Note that the `IfBlockClause`s within this `IfBlock` are derived from `CodeExecutable`
      and as such also have a `authors` property. Given that, this `authors` property is
      somewhat redundant but added for consistency with `CodeChunk`, `ForBlock` and other
      block level nodes that have the `authors` property.
