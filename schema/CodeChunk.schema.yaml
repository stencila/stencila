      In languages such as Python and R we are unable
      to differentiate between an assignment that
      is a declaration and an assignment that is an alteration
      (a re-assignment).
      The "primary" compiler keeps a track of the variables
      declared in code chunks prior to the current chunk in the
      document and may treat an assignment as a declaration.

      This property allows users to add undetected
      alterations (i.e. not assignments) to this list. Chunks that alter a variable
      need to be inserted into the dependency graph between `declares` and `uses`
