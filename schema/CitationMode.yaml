description: The mode of a `Cite`.
$comment: |
  There are two main citation modes: parenthetical and narrative (a.k.a textual).
  See https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/parenthetical-versus-narrative
  for an explanation.

  This property is optional and tools are recommended to assume `parenthetical` if missing.

  Narrative citations will usually be of form "As noted by Smith (1992)," but `narrative-author`
  allows for "In the early nineties, Smith noted" and `narrative-year` allows for "As noted by Smith in 1992 and 1993".

  Pandoc's `CitationMode` enumeration has `Normal` (for `parenthetical`), `AuthorInText` (for `textual`),
  and `SuppressAuthor` (for `textual-year`).
  See https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/blob/0158cd0e2a2ca9d6f14389a1a57bc64cab45a7dd/src/Text/Pandoc/Definition.hs#L353.

  LaTeX's `natbib` package has `\citep{}` (for `parenthetical`), `\citet{}` (for `textual`),
  `\citeauthor{}` (for `textual-author`), `\citeyear{}` (for `textual-year`).
