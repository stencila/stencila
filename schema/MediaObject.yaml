description: |
  A media object, such as an image, video, or audio object embedded in a web page or a
  downloadable dataset.

  This is not an abstract type and so can be instantiated as an inline content node.
  However, prefer to use `AudioObject`, `ImageObject`, or `VideoObject` when the
  type of media is known.

  contentUrl:
    '@id': schema:contentUrl
    description: |
      URL for the actual bytes of the media object, for example the image file or video file.

      To allow for file paths, including possibly erroneous paths, neither `format` nor `pattern`
      JSON Schema keywords are used here, or on `embedUrl`.
      
      `contentUrl` is required since it seems to make little sense to have a `MediaObject`
      that does not have it.

      See https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/462#issuecomment-98243384
      for why it is useful to have both `contentUrl` and `embedUrl` in addition to `url`.

      This property is more restrictive than https://schema.org/encodingFormat which
      expects either Text or URL for this property. This schema expects a media type e.g. `text/html`
      as listed at http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml.
