  This is an implementation, and extension, of schema.org [`Article`](https://schema.org/Article).
  It extends schema.org `Article` by adding a `content` property which must be
  an array of [`Block`](./Block), as well as the properties added by
  [`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork) which it extends.
