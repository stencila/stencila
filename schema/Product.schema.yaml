  The `Product` type allows you to provide details about a product such as the product
  brand, logo and ID. This type can be used as any kind of product that is not [`CreativeWork`](./CreativeWork) item.

  `Product` is analogous, and structurally similar to, the 
  JATS XML [`<product>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/element/product.html) element which
  contains the metadata concerning one product (for example, a book, software package, website, or
  hardware component) discussed in an article.

  To meet Google's guidelines for [`Product`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/product#product)
  instances are required to have `image` and `name` properties.
