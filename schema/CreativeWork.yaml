  This is an implementation, and extension, of schema.org [`CreativeWork`](https://schema.org/CreativeWork).
  It extends schema.org `CreativeWork` by, adding several properties including `dateAccepted`
  and `fundedBy`.
properties:
  about:
    '@id': schema:about
    description: The subject matter of the content.
    $comment: |
      Consistent with https://schema.org/about, this property allows for
      linking to one of more `Thing` nodes. This could for example include
      a `Person` (e.g for a bibliography) or a `DefinedTerm` (e.g. for
      subject areas the creative work relates to).
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: ThingType

  editors:
    '@id': schema:editor
    description: People who edited the `CreativeWork`.
    $comment: |
      Note that, consistent with schema.org, this property can only include
      a `Person`, unlike `authors` and `maintainers` which can also include
      `Organization`.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: Person
    strip: [metadata]
    serde:
      deserializeWith: option_one_or_many_string_or_object
    dom:
      elem: section
  maintainers:
    '@id': schema:maintainer
    description: The maintainers of the `CreativeWork`.
    $comment: |
      A maintainer of a `Dataset`, `SoftwareApplication`, or other `CreativeWork`.
      A maintainer is a `Person` or `Organization` that manages contributions to,
      and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for
      distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources.
      When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular
      version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream
      source has a different maintainer. The `isBasedOn` property can be used to
      indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance
      roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated
      maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu,
      as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

    $comment: |
      This follows the proposal [here](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258)
      for a property that is the reverse of `fundedItems`.
      It is an any because a `CreativeWork` may have been funded through more than
      one `Grant`.

      In this case `string` is listed as an alternative before `number` to
      avoid semantic version numbers e.g. `1.0` being parsed, and subsequently
      encoded, as `1` thereby resulting in loss of information.
