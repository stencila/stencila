description: A group of `Citation` nodes.
$comment: |
  This type allows you to group associated citations together.
  When some content in a [`Creative Work`](./CreativeWork) Citations more than one
  reference for a particular piece of text, use a `CitationGroup` to encapsulate
  multiple [`Citation`](./Citation) nodes.

  At present we do not give a `citationMode` property to a `CitationGroup` since
  they will almost always be parenthetical as opposed to narrative.
  In other words, it usually only makes sense for individual `Citation` nodes to be
  narrative (although they may be connected together within `content` using words
  such as "and").
