  For example a `Role` can be used to say that a 'member' role linking some `SportsTeam` 
  to a player occurred during a particular time period. Or that a `Person`'s 'actor' role in a `Movie`
  was for some particular `characterName`. Such properties can be attached to a `Role` entity,
  which is then associated with the main entities using ordinary properties like 'member' or 'actor'.
