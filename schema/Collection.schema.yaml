  A created collection of CreativeWorks or other artefacts.
# The [schema.org defintion](https://schema.org/Collection) adds
# `collectionSize` but has not been added here because that feels
# redudant e.g. a developer could use `collection.parts.length` instead
required:
  # Note that `parts` is defined in `CreativeWork` but made
  # a requirement here. A creative work need not be required to have
  # parts, but a collection should.
