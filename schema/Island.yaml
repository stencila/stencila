    $comment: |
      When the `--island-wrap` decoding option is used and the island has been
      automatically generated by wrapping a document element, then this will be true.
      Used when encoding the island back to the source format to determine whether
      the explicit island syntax is required or not.

      Used to register secondary IDs (e.g. subfigure labels) as link targets.
      The primary `id` is typically the last label (main figure/table label),
      and these other IDs are also registered for cross-referencing.
