description: A union type for a part of a message.
$comment: |
  This union type uses `Text`, instead of `string`, so that each type of part
  is an entity with a type and node id.
dom:
  derive: false
anyOf:
  - $ref: Text
  - $ref: ImageObject
  - $ref: AudioObject
  - $ref: VideoObject
  - $ref: File
