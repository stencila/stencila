  Analogues of `Strikeout` in other schema include:
    - HTML [`<del>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del)
    - JATS XML [`<strike>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.2/element/strike.html)
    - MDAST [`Delete`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#delete)
    - Pandoc [`Strikeout`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/blob/1.17.5.4/Text/Pandoc/Definition.hs#L258)
  Supersedes the `Delete` inline content type (the name "Strikeout" is less ambiguous than "Delete").
