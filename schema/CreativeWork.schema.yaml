      Consistent with https://schema.org/about, this property allows for
      linking to one of more `Thing` nodes. This could for example include
      a `Person` (e.g for a bibliography) or a `DefinedTerm` (e.g. for
      subject areas the creative work relates to).

      This follows the proposal [here](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258)
      for a property that is the reverse of `fundedItems`.
      It is an any because a `CreativeWork` may have been funded through more than
      one `Grant`.

      A maintainer of a Dataset, SoftwareApplication, or other CreativeWork.
      A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to,
      and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for
      distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources.
      When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular
      version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream
      source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to
      indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance
      roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated
      maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu,
      as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

      Allows for the title to include inline content (e.g `Strong`, `Math`)
      or a string. The title can not be block content e.g `Paragraph`.
      The `minItems` restriction avoids a string being coerced into an array
      with a single string item.

      In this case `string` is listed as an alternative before `number` to
      avoid semantic version numbers e.g. `1.0` being parsed, and subsequently
      encoded, as `1` thereby resulting in loss of information.
