description: Abstract base class for nodes that indicate a suggested change to inline content.
$comment: |
  Note that at present this type does not have a `suggester` property to identify the
  actor (`Person`, `Organization`, or `SoftwareApplication`) which suggested the change.
  That is because, the creator of a `Suggestion` node is inherently the suggester and 
  will be identifiable from the node's id.
  
  The suggester will normally be amongst the `authors`, `contributors`, or `maintainers`
  of the `CreativeWork`.
