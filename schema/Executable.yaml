      Intended to increment with each successive execution of the node, including across sessions.
      Note that this differs to the `execution_count` in Jupyter Notebook format which is
      the "code cell's prompt number" and which resets at the start of each new session.

    $comment: |
      Used to help identify whether execution is required due to the last execution
      being in a difference instance (e.g. after a kernel restart).
