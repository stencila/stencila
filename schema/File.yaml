  Previously this type extended `CreativeWork`.
  However, to avoid consuming more memory than necessary when creating directory listings
  with many files, it now extends `Entity`.
required:
  - name
  - path

  name:
    '@id': schema:name
    description: The name of the file.

      This property is more restrictive than https://schema.org/encodingFormat which
      expects either Text or URL for this property. This schema expects a media type e.g. `text/html`
      as listed at http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml.
    type: string
    pattern: '^\w+/[-+.\w]+$'
