  Previously this type extended `CreativeWork`.
  However, to avoid consuming more memory than necessary when creating directory listings
  with many files, it now extends `Entity`.

      This property is more restrictive than https://schema.org/encodingFormat which
      expects either Text or URL for this property. This schema expects a media type e.g. `text/html`
      as listed at http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml.

      Similar to the HTTP Transfer-Encoding header (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding).
      Mostly used to indicates whether the content of the file is Base64 encoded.

      For binary formats, such as images, the content should be Base64 encoded.
