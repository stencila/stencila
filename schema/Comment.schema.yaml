  Use the `about` property to define the item that a comment is on and
  `commentAspect` to point to a specific part of aspect of that item.
  The `content` property should be used for the structured content of the
  comment, in preference to the schema.org `text` property (which is expected to
  be plain text). Replies to a comment can be added to its `comments` property
  or have their `parentItem` set to the parent comment.
properties:
  parentItem:
    '@id': schema:parentItem
    description: The parent comment of this comment.
    $ref: Comment
  commentAspect:
    '@id': stencila:commentAspect
    description: The part or facet of the item that is being commented on.

      This propery is analagous to the `reviewAspect` property of the `reviewAspect`
      type. It is a string to allow flexibility in how the aspect is expressed
      depending on the item e.g "technique", for a comment on a painting, or
      "some_code.py#L10-L20" for a comment on a software code repository.
