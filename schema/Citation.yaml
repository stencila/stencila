  A `Citation` node is used within a [`CreativeWork`](./creative-work.md), usually an
  [`Article`](./article.md), to refer to an other `CreativeWork`.
  Often a `Citation` will be associated with other citations, in a `CitationGroup`.

      Previously this was name `prefix` but for consistency with `citationMode`
      and `honorificPrefix`, to avoid ambiguity with other prefixes was renamed
      to `citationPrefix`.

      See comment on `citationPrefix` regarding naming.
