  Always use specific properties when they exist and you can populate them.
  Using `PropertyValue` as a substitute will typically not convey as much semantic
  information as using the specific property.

  Most of the time a `PropertyValue` node will need a `value` property
  (e.g. most of the examples on https://schema.org/PropertyValue have one)
  so this schema make that property required.

  This type is mainly provided for use in `Thing.identifiers` (see the notes there).
properties:
  propertyID:
    '@id': schema:propertyID
    description: A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property.
    type: string
  value:
    '@id': schema:value
    description: The value of the property.
