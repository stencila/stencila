description: Union type for all schema nodes, including primitives and entities
$comment: |
  The entity types in this union are automatically inserted during the build.
  The order of these types is important because it determines the
  order of attempted coercion (ie. parsing and reshaping to arrays).
  Array should come last to avoid single items (e.g. a single string)
  being coerced into an array.
anyOf:
  - $ref: 'Null'
  - $ref: Boolean
  - $ref: Integer
  - $ref: Number
  - $ref: String
  - $ref: Object
  - $ref: Array
