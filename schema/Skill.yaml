description: An agent skill providing instructions for AI agents.
$comment: |
  An implementation of the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
  A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a Markdown body
  that provides instructions for AI agents. Skills support progressive disclosure: metadata
  (~100 tokens) is loaded at startup, full instructions on activation, and referenced files
  on demand.

      Must be lowercase kebab-case: 1-64 characters, only lowercase alphanumeric
      and hyphens, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens. By convention, names
      follow a `thing-activity` pattern describing the skill's domain and action,
      e.g. `code-review`, `data-analysis`, `site-design`.

      The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no
      format restrictions per the spec. Recommended sections include step-by-step instructions,
      examples of inputs and outputs, and common edge cases.

      Max 500 characters per the spec. Indicates intended product, required system packages,
      network access needs, etc. Most skills do not need this field.

      Experimental per the spec. In the spec this is a space-delimited string named
      `allowed-tools`; we parse it into an array of strings for easier programmatic use.
