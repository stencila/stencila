description: An agent skill providing instructions for AI agents.
$comment: |
  An implementation of the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
  A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and a Markdown body
  that provides instructions for AI agents. Skills support progressive disclosure: metadata
  (~100 tokens) is loaded at startup, full instructions on activation, and referenced files
  on demand.

      The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no
      format restrictions per the spec. Recommended sections include step-by-step instructions,
      examples of inputs and outputs, and common edge cases.

      Experimental per the spec. In the spec this is a space-delimited string named
      `allowed-tools`; we parse it into an array of strings for easier programmatic use.
