  This is an implementation of schema.org [`Collection`](https://schema.org/Collection).
  The `Collection` type allows you to represent a collection of various `CreativeWork`
  node types, such as [`Article`](./Article), [`Datatable`](./Datatable) or [`Table`](./Table).

  The schema.org `Collection` has a `collectionSize` property but has not been added here
  because it is somewhat redundant e.g. a developer could use `collection.parts.length` instead.

  derive: false
required:
  # Note that `parts` is defined in `CreativeWork` but made
  # a requirement here. A creative work need not be required to have
  # parts, but a collection should.
  - parts
