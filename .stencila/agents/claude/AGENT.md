description: Claude Code CLI with local settings and standard system prompt
provider: claude-cli
# Note: this is a uncustomized Anthropic Claude Code CLI agent that will use
# the default settings for model, reasoning effort, MCP servers etc
# that are configured via your local `codex`. So no other config,
# or system prompt, is required here.
