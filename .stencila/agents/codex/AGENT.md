description: Codex CLI with local settings and standard system prompt
provider: codex-cli
# Note: this is a uncustomized OpenAI Codex CLI agent that will use
# the default settings for model, reasoning effort, MCP servers etc
# that are configured via your local `codex`. So no other config,
# or system prompt, is required here.
