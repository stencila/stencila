title: Generating Code and Text
---

• Let's write a short scientific [document](file:open).

• We're going to write about modeling [Predator Prey interactions](type:0).

• We'll use the ``insert-expand-ideas`` assistant to write a coherent narrative based on a [few ideas](type:1).

• If you press the run button, the assistant will generate a few paragraphs of text, attempting to connect the ideas.

• A graph will help show what is going on. So let's generate [some relevant code](type:2).

• The assistant will generate a code snippet that plots the population dynamics of foxes and rabbits.

• You can then run that code to see the actual plot. Press the view button to open the document.

- brief history of lotka-volterra equations
- explain the model and its relevance.
- A puzzle; but turns out explicable just by equations
- fox and rabbit example

::: do @insert-code-figure plot of the population dynamics of foxes and rabbits, showing a few cycles, put the parameters and initial conditions in the caption.
