title: Stencila uses Markdown
---

Let's create some basic markdown.

Starting with [a title](type:0)

And then some [formatted text](type:1)

Now we can [add some code](type:2)

Let's run that code. It is kinda like a notebook.

We can get assistance in [writing code](type:3)

And now we can run that too.

That is just the beginning.

---

# A simple document

---

We can write some text with __formatting__ and [links](https://stencila.com).

---

```python exec
print("Hello world!")
```
