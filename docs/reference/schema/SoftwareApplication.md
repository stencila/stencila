# Software Application

**A software application.**

`SoftwareApplication` represents a software application that can be located by name and version. It may be fetched in binary format or some package manager (npm, pip, etc) could fetch and compile the source code. Although by using the `softwareRequirements` property it is possible to represent a full hierarchy of required packages, normally it is adequate to only list the immediate dependencies and allow the system/language package manager to resolve the rest.

## Notes

1. **about** : Consistent with https://schema.org/about, this property allows for linking to one of more `Thing` nodes. This could for example include a `Person` (e.g for a bibliography) or a `DefinedTerm` (e.g. for subject areas the creative work relates to).
2. **dateAccepted** : This is not yet a schema.org property but the term is used [in Dublin Core](http://purl.org/dc/terms/dateAccepted).
3. **description** : Allows for the description to be an array of nodes (e.g. an array of inline content, or a couple of paragraphs), or a string. The `minItems` restriction avoids a string being coerced into an array with a single string item.
4. **fundedBy** : This follows the proposal [here](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258) for a property that is the reverse of `fundedItems`. It is an any because a `CreativeWork` may have been funded through more than one `Grant`.
5. **identifiers** : Some identifiers have specific properties e.g the `issn` property for the `Periodical` type. These should be used in preference to this property which is intended for identifiers that do not yet have a specific property. Identifiers can be represented as strings, but using a `PropertyValue` will usually be better because it allows for `propertyID` (i.e. the type of identifier).
6. **maintainers** : A maintainer of a Dataset, SoftwareApplication, or other CreativeWork. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.
7. **title** : Allows for the title to include inline content (e.g `Strong`, `Math`) or a string. The title can not be block content e.g `Paragraph`. The `minItems` restriction avoids a string being coerced into an array with a single string item.
8. **version** : In this case `string` is listed as an alternative before `number` to avoid semantic version numbers e.g. `1.0` being parsed, and subsequently encoded, as `1` thereby resulting in loss of information.
