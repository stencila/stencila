So, Bob (my cousin) and I were talking to his sister, Alice, the other day.
And then she said to me, "Hey Wombat, I'm going to go to the store."
And there she met her daughter, Jane, and their dog, Spot.
Spot is a good dog. He comes from the same litter as my dog, Fido.
Sometimes Fido is like a son to me.
