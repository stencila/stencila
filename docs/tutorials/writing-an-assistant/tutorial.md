# Building a custom assistant

## Background

This tutorial walks you through creating a custom assistant. "Assistants" are Stencila’s term for agents that collaborate with you when writing a document.
The assistants in Stencila are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT, and Stencila has access to a number of the most popular LLM’s built-in. Typically, you’ll need a key to access them (see elsewhere for set up details).
