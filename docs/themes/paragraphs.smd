# Tokens

## Spacing Tokens

A semantic scale of spacing tokens for different typographic contexts and visual hierarchy.

| Token                     | Description                         | Default Value                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `--paragraph-spacing-sm`  | Small spacing for list items        | `var(--space-3)`             |
| `--paragraph-spacing-md`  | Standard paragraph and list spacing | `var(--space-4)`             |
| `--paragraph-spacing-lg`  | Large spacing for blocks and quotes | `var(--space-6)`             |
| `--paragraph-line-height` | Line height within paragraphs       | `var(--line-height-relaxed)` |

## Text Flow Tokens

Control text alignment, indentation, and hyphenation for different document styles.

| Token                     | Description                                   | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--paragraph-text-align`  | Text alignment (left, right, center, justify) | `left`        |
| `--paragraph-text-indent` | First-line indentation                        | `0`           |
| `--paragraph-hyphens`     | Hyphenation control (none, auto, manual)      | `none`        |

## Typography Enhancement Tokens

Advanced typography features. A _lead_ paragraph is the first paragraph after a heading.

| Token                          | Description                                     | Default Value |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--paragraph-orphans`          | Minimum lines at bottom of page/column break    | `2`           |
| `--paragraph-widows`           | Minimum lines at top of page/column break       | `2`           |
| `--paragraph-text-wrap`        | Text wrapping algorithm (auto, pretty, balance) | `auto`        |
| `--paragraph-lead-font-size`   | Font size for lead paragraphs                   | `inherit`     |
| `--paragraph-lead-font-weight` | Font weight for lead paragraphs                 | `inherit`     |
| `--paragraph-lead-text-indent` | First-line indentation for lead paragraphs      | `0`           |

# Usage

## Spacing Context

Each spacing token serves a specific purpose in research and technical document layout:

**sm (0.75rem)**: Used for `li p+p` - multiple paragraphs within list items need tighter spacing.

**md (1rem)**: Standard spacing for regular content:

- `p` elements - body text paragraphs
- `ul, ol` - list containers

**lg (1.5rem)**: Larger spacing for special blocks that need visual separation:

- `pre` - code blocks and algorithms
- `blockquote` - quoted literature or equations
- `hr` - section dividers

## Text Flow Control

**Text alignment**: Choose between `left` (web standard), `justify` (scholarly papers), `center` (titles), or `right` (specialized layouts).

**Text indentation**: Use `--paragraph-text-indent` for traditional scholarly formatting. Common values:

- `0` - Web/modern style (no indent)
- `1.5em` - Standard scholarly indent
- `1.463rem` - Traditional LaTeX paragraph indent

**Hyphenation**: Control word breaking:

- `none` - No hyphenation (web default)
- `auto` - Automatic hyphenation (recommended for justified text)
- `manual` - Only break at explicit hyphens

## Typography Enhancement

**Orphans and widows**: Control how paragraphs break across pages/columns to prevent single lines appearing isolated.

**Text wrap**: Modern browsers support improved line breaking with `text-wrap: pretty` for better readability.

# Patterns

## Research Paper Style

Traditional scholarly document with justified text and paragraph indentation:

```css
:root {
  --paragraph-text-align: justify;
  --paragraph-text-indent: 1.5em;
  --paragraph-hyphens: auto;
  --paragraph-spacing-md: 1rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-lg: 1.5rem;
}
```

```html raw
<div
  style="
  --paragraph-text-align: justify;
  --paragraph-text-indent: 1.5em;
  --paragraph-hyphens: auto;
  --paragraph-spacing-md: 1rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-lg: 1.5rem;
  max-width: 60ch;
"
>
  <h3>Methods</h3>
  <p>
    We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
    the proposed algorithm. Participants were recruited from three research
    institutions across North America between January 2023 and March 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary endpoint was computational efficiency measured in operations per
    second. Secondary endpoints included memory usage, error rates, and user
    satisfaction scores collected via standardized questionnaires.
  </p>
  <p>
    Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.3.0. All tests were
    two-tailed with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Missing data were handled
    using multiple imputation techniques.
  </p>
</div>
```

## Technical Documentation

Clean, left-aligned text optimized for code and technical content:

```css
:root {
  --paragraph-text-align: left;
  --paragraph-text-indent: 0;
  --paragraph-spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-md: 0.75rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-lg: 1rem;
  --paragraph-text-wrap: pretty;
}
```

```html raw
<div
  style="
  --paragraph-text-align: left;
  --paragraph-text-indent: 0;
  --paragraph-spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-md: 0.75rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-lg: 1rem;
  --paragraph-text-wrap: pretty;
  max-width: 70ch;
"
>
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>
    Install the package using npm or pip depending on your environment. The
    installation process automatically handles dependencies and sets up the
    required configuration files.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Python environments, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. For
    JavaScript environments, Node.js 16 or higher is required.
  </p>
  <pre>pip install research-toolkit</pre>
</div>
```

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Machine learning algorithms have shown promising results in predicting
    protein folding structures, but computational complexity remains a
    significant barrier to widespread adoption in clinical settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    This study presents a novel approach combining transformer architectures
    with physics-based constraints to achieve 95% accuracy while reducing
    computational time by 60% compared to existing methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our results demonstrate that hybrid models can bridge the gap between
    theoretical precision and practical implementation, opening new
    possibilities for real-time protein structure prediction in drug discovery
    pipelines.
  </p>

  --paragraph-spacing-md: 1.4rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-lg: 2rem;
  --paragraph-line-height: 1.7;
  --paragraph-text-wrap: pretty;
}
```

```html raw
<div
  style="
  --paragraph-text-align: left;
  --paragraph-spacing-md: 1.4rem;
  --paragraph-spacing-lg: 2rem;
  --paragraph-line-height: 1.7;
  --paragraph-text-wrap: pretty;
  max-width: 70ch;

  <h3>Literature Review</h3>
  <p>
    The field of computational biology has witnessed remarkable advances in the
    past decade, driven largely by the availability of large datasets and
    improved algorithmic approaches. Early work by Smith et al. (2018) laid the
    foundation for sequence-based prediction methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subsequent research has focused on integrating multiple data modalities,
    including structural information, evolutionary relationships, and functional
    annotations. The breakthrough came with the introduction of attention
    mechanisms, which allowed models to capture long-range dependencies in
    protein sequences.

# Tips

**Choose alignment for context**: Use `left` for web/technical content, `justify` for scholarly papers, but ensure proper hyphenation with justified text.

**Indent consistently**: If using `--paragraph-text-indent`, set `--paragraph-lead-text-indent: 0` to skip indentation after headings, following scholarly conventions.

**Control orphans/widows**: For print or PDF output, increase `--paragraph-orphans` and `--paragraph-widows` to 3 or more to prevent awkward line breaks.

**Use lead paragraphs strategically**: Apply `p.lead` class to opening paragraphs in research abstracts, executive summaries, or article introductions.

**Consider hyphenation carefully**: Enable `--paragraph-hyphens: auto` only with justified text, and test across different browsers for consistent results.

**Optimize for reading length**: Combine appropriate `--paragraph-spacing-*` tokens with `max-width` to maintain optimal line lengths (45-75 characters).

**Modern text wrapping**: Use `--paragraph-text-wrap: pretty` in supported browsers for improved line breaking, especially in technical documentation.

**Test across contexts**: Paragraph tokens work differently in lists, blockquotes, and special elements - verify appearance in all content types.

**Spacing serves hierarchy**: Use `sm` for tight contexts (list items), `md` for standard content, `lg` for special blocks that need visual separation.
