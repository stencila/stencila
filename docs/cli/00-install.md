To install the Stencila CLI you can either use our convenience function:

```sh
curl -sSf https://stencila.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Or go to the [release page on GitHub](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/releases), download and install it yourself for your specific platform.

If there is no pre-built binary for your platform, you can also build from source. Instructions are available in the source repository [`READM.md`](https://github.com/stencila/stencila/blob/main/README.md)
