# Markdown Overview

This walkthrough is a guide for those who may not have a lot of practice
with Markdown, or who's Markdown knowledge is a bit rusty. We encourage
you to practice in the space provided at the bottom of each section 
and have a Stencila Preview window open to see how things are being 
styled into HTML. 

## Learning objectives

1. Become exposed to the most common piece of markdown syntax
2. Practice crafting your own styled Markdown, or example that is realted to your own work
3. Building awareness of how Markdown gets styled by Stencila's preview window


### 1. Headers
You can create headers by using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header.

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

> [!info]
> Try creating your own headers below.

### 2. Emphasis
You can emphasize text using asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`).

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_

**Bold** or __Bold__

~~Strikethrough~~
```

> [!info]
> Try it yourself below. Type some text and see if you can add 
> **emphasis** to it. ~~Or cross it out maybe~~. Or maybe just *Italicize* it.

### 3. Lists
You can create both unordered and ordered lists.

- **Unordered Lists**: Use `*`, `+`, or `-`:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Subitem 2.1
  * Subitem 2.2
```

- **Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by a period:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
```

> [!info]
> Have a go yourself, make a few lists and explore nesting.

### 4. Links
To create hyperlinks, use the format `[link text](URL)`.

```markdown
[Stencila](https://stencila.io)
```
The bit in `[]` is the link text, the bit between the `()` is the 
URL. 

> [!info]
> Have a go and see if you can type a link to a favorite 
> website or two. 

Try here: 



...

### 6. Blockquotes
Use the `>` symbol to create blockquotes.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

They're great for when you're quoting someone. 

> [!info]
> Give it a try, create a block quote or two below

Try here:

### 9. Tables
To create tables, use pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`):

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   |
| Row 2    | Data 2   |
```

> [!info]
> Give it a try, see if you can craft your own Markdown table.

Try here: 



...

### That should get you started! 

You've now practiced several of the most common types of styling 
syntax in Markdown. Markdown lets you write plain text, but have
it rendered into attractive documents.
