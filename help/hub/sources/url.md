A URL source lets you pull content from a website or API into your project. Useful when you wish to fetch and analysis data such as from data repositories or Github. Quite often these are CSV files.

## Creating an URL source

To add an URL as a project source:

* Go to the project **Sources** page

* Press the **New** button and select **URL**

* Enter the source **URL** and the **Path** that you want to link it to within the project (what you want to name your source) and **Create Source**

Your URL source is automatically **pulled** into your project and stores in your project's working directory.

## Refresh your URL

At any time in the future you can go back and pull in an updated version of your source. 

To do this simply click the **Source** tab from the side bar, click to view the pop up at the end of URL source and **Pull**.
