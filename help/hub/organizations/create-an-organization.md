You can use your existing personal Stencila account to work on projects or you can choose to set up an organization and work within it. The advance of creating an organization is so that a collection of user accounts can be associated with it and work collaboratively on projects. 

Public projects that belong to an organization are accessible to users in other organizations, while private projects are inaccessible to anyone but members of the organization.

Whoever sets up your organization will automatically become the **owner**. They can then add other Stencila users and assign them a role. Organizations can have one or more owners, who have administrative privileges for the organization. 

**Member**:  can create, update and delete projects.

**Manager**: as for member and can create, update and delete teams.

**Owner**: as for manager and can also add and remove users and change their role.

## Set up an organization    

Search for your organization name to double check it has not already been set up before you add a new one.
