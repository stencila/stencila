Once you've [created a project](./create-a-project.md) and updated your settings to [choose your theme](../organizations/manage-organization-settings.md) you are ready to start working.

Within your project click **New** and choose from the drop down menu.

## Upload a file or folder

You can [upload a file](../sources/upload.md) directly from your computer to your Stencila project to use within the project's executable documents. The files are managed on Stencila servers and do not need to be pulled. You can upload a folder with multiple files in the same way. 

## Link a source

In addition to uploading files to a project, you can link sources to your project that are hosted elsewhere.

These sources remain on the external service, but a versioned copy is downloaded (pulled) and stored with your project to maintain reproducibility. When you start a compute session to run your project, we will mount the pulled files into the session.

* [URL Source](../sources/upload.md)
* [Google Docs Source](../sources/google-docs.md)
* [Google Drive Source](../sources/google-drive.md) 
* [GitHub Source](../sources/url.md)

You can go to the sources tab of your project at any time in the future to update the local copies of your source files by **pulling** them.

Once linked you can perform various tasks.

Once converted to your chosen format you can perform other tasks. For example you might wish to download a file to enrich it and then upload it.
