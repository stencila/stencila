The advance of [creating an organization](./create-an-organization.md) is so that a collection of user accounts can be associated with it and work collaboratively on projects.

## User roles

There are three different user roles to choose from:

**Member**: can create, update and delete projects.

**Manager**: as for member and can create, update and delete teams.

**Owner**: as for manager and can also add and remove users and change their role.
