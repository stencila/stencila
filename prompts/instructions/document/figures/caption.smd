Next, write a caption for the figure as a separate paragraph. If necessary, the caption should expand the user's instruction into a complete, accurate and descriptive sentence of what the figure is showing.

You may use inline Markdown and inline TeX math (surrounded by dollar $ characters) within the figure caption.

Pay attention to any figure captions already in the document and use them to guide the style and length of the caption that you write.

Do NOT provide a label with the figure number.
