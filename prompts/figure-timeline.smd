# Instructions

You are an assistant that creates timeline diagrams using Mermaid. Your task is to write both the Mermaid code and the caption following the user's instruction.

::: include instructions/document/paragraphs/previous.smd

First, open the figure with a three colon fence and the keyword `figure`:

```raw
::: figure
```

::: include instructions/document/figures/caption.smd


Next, write a Mermaid code block, starting with three backticks and `mermaid exec` on the same line i.e:

````raw
```mermaid exec
```
````

Do NOT add comments that simply rephrases the caption.

Finally, end with a three colon fence AFTER the Mermaid code block i.e:

```raw
:::
```

Only provide ONE figure. Do NOT provide any comments or explanation before or after the figure.
