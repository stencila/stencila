        <div data-title="">Welcome to Stencila</div>
        <p>Stencila is the office suite for reproducible research. With Stencila you can produce rich computation-intensive publications without requiring programming knowledge.</p>
        <p>Cells are the excutable (dynamic) bits of a document. They produce a result as you type. Try to modify the following cell:</p>
        <div data-cell="3 * 0.25"></div>
        <p>Cells use a very simple expression language called <em>Mini</em> to allow you to perform common data analysis and visualisation tasks within the document. </p>
        <p>You can edit this document just like in a traditional word processor. Press <code>enter</code> to start a new paragraph or insert a table or cell.</p>
        <p>Here's a cell that reads some fictitous ice cream sales data from a CSV (comma separated values) string using the <code>csv</code> function.</p>
        <div data-cell="data = csv('temp,sunny,sales
18,no,50
20,yes,126
24,yes,118
23,yes,126
26,yes,280
25,no,102
20,no,93
17,no,32
18,yes,103
28,yes,246
')"></div>
        <p>The variable <code>data</code> is a table and is now a part of of the document scope - the set of variables the document knows about. Let's filter the table to only show data for days when the temperature is less than 20 degrees.</p>
        <div data-cell="filter(data,'temp < 20')"></div>
        <p>Notice that because we didn't assign the result of filter to a value the output gets displayed. You can change this behaviour by setting the cell's output visibility to <code>Hide</code>.</p>
        <p>Cells can also be used to plot your data. The <code>plot</code> function is a generic function that allows you to visualize data using various visual encodings.</p>
        <div data-cell="plot(data, 'points', x='temp', y='sales', color='sunny')"></div>
        <p>When you want to combine several functions in one cell the pipe operator can produce more readable expressions:</p>
        <div data-cell="filtered_data = filter(data, 'temp<=20')"></div>
        <div data-cell="squares(filtered_data, x='temp',y='sales',color='sunny')
  | titles(x='Temperature', y='Ice Creams Sold', color='Sunny Day')
  | theme({square: {size: 120}})"></div>
        <p>The nice thing about using Mini is that the dependency between cells can be automatically determined. So if you change the value in one cell, all the other cells that depend on tht value will automatically update - just like in a spreadsheet. Try altering the filtering expression in the <code>filtered_data</code> cell above.</p>
        <p>You can also let your readers alter document variables directly using <code>inputs</code> and inspect their value with <code>outputs</code>. Heres an example: if the diameter of a circle is <input type="range" name="diameter" min="0" max="100" step="1" value="68"></input> m then it's circumference is <output for="circumference">213.52</output> m.</p>
        <div data-cell="circumference = 3.14 * diameter"></div>
        <p>See the <strong>Stencila Manual</strong> for more on what you can do with Mini, including running code in other languages.</p>
        <p><em>We're still in beta development, so it's great having people like you testing things out!
