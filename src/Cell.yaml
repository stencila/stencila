      Cells in Sheets usually have `{"expr": true}`.

      Cells imported from Jupyter Notebooks or RMarkdown have `{"global": true}`
      to match the execution model of those platforms.

      An array of cell inputs.

      This is an `array`, rather than an `object` to be consistent with the structure
      of cell `outputs` and to allow for unnamed inputs in the future.

      Currently it is assumed that there is a single output. However, this is an 
      `array` to allow for multiple outputs in the future.

      User options for compiling and executing this cell. The number, names and values of options
      is flexible and will depend upon the capabilities of the language and the execution context.

      An example usage is to store RMarkdown code chunk [options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/). 
      These are used to specify things like figure sizes. For example, the RMarkdown chunk with options
      `{r fig.height=10, fig.width=5}` gets converted into a cell with `"options": {"fig.height": "10", "fig.width": "5"}`.
