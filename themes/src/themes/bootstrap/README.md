# Bootstrap

A theme that pulls itself up using Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) toolkit.

Designed as an illustration of a theme built entirely using an existing CSS stylesheet. Being an illustrative theme, it:

- includes gratuitous use of Bootstrap components
- does not use an styles or mixins from the `shared` folder.

For a real theme, you probably don't want to do either of these things. See [`styles.css`](styles.css) and [`index.ts`](index.ts) for further comments.
