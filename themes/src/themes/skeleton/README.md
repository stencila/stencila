# Skeleton

A theme with lots of bones but no flesh. Designed to be used as a starting point for creating new themes, it tries to be
as unopinionated as possible.

It demonstrates how to use the custom semantic selectors, but the theme only styles a handful of them. For a full and up
to date list of all available selectors, please see `../../selectors.css`

To create a new theme using `skeleton`, simply duplicate this folder, rename it to your themeâ€˜s name and run `npm run generate:themes`.
