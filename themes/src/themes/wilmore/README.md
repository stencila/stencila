# Wilmore

A theme well suited for consuming long-form manuscripts and prose. Named after Edmond Dantés' alias, [“Lord Wilmore: An
Englishman, and the persona in which Dantès performs random acts of
generosity.“](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo#Edmond_Dantès_and_his_aliases)
