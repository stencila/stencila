# Galleria

A theme for galleries of `CreativeWork` nodes.

This theme builds on the `stencila` theme to target `Article` documents where the main content is a `List` of `CreativeWork`s, each having properties such as `title`, `author`, and `publisher` and usually, but not necessarily a `MediaObject`, such as a thumbnail image of the work. Use cases include a presenting a list of other articles, or a gallery of images or videos.
