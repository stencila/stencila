# Math styling extension.

Provides styling of math nodes using MathJax fonts and styles. Use this if there is any likely to be math content, i.e. `MathFragment` and/or `MathBlock` nodes, in documents that your theme targets.

## Notes

- This module does not include any of MathJax's Javascript for rendering math content in TeX. That is because Encoda does the pre-rendering as part of it's encoding to HTML.
