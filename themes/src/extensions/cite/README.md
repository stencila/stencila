# Citation extension

Provides styling for in-text citations (i.e. `Cite` and `CiteGroup` nodes) and bibliographies (i.e. `CreativeWork` nodes in the `references` property of another `CreativeWork`).

This extension acts as a base for other extensions e.g. `cite-apa` that provide styling for a particular citation style.
