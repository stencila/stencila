Today we want to share with you a functional prototype implementing that vision.</p>
    <p id="p-0bfacde325c4587acb2ddf47ae68c879">The article you are reading right now was written in Stencila, an open source office suite for reproducible research.

      <p id="p-39e1297085042143a2f79b3f9d9f9994">Publications are represented as self-contained archives of documents and assets, building on open standards, such as JATS XML, which have been widely adopted within the publishing industry. Together with experts from open science communities we defined extensions to add source code, data and methods to the journal-ready manuscript.</p>

Because the execution engine analyses the dependencies between cells, it can perform a minimal update, making computation fast and responsive. This mechanism works with all available languages (e.g. R, Python, Javascript, SQL). You can even mix languages within a document.

Cells were cultured in two separate lots of serum. Transcripts/cell estimates from NanoString nCounter gene expression assays (1369 genes assay) for active (left) and silent (right) genes at 0, 1, and 24 hr after release from Tet. Active genes expressed greater than one transcript/cell. Silent genes expressed less than 0.5 transcript/cell. Box and whisker plots with median represented as the line through the box and whiskers representing values within 1.5 IQR of the first and third quartile. Cells grown in serum lot one: active genes = 708, silent genes = 580. Cells grown in serum lot two: active genes = 719, silent genes = 573.</p>
