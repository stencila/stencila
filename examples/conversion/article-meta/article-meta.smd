An example article for testing metadata encoding in various formats. It illustrates Stencila's focus on the [Robustness Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle): <q>be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others</q>. Metadata can be added to YAML front-matter in Markdown documents in a variety of ways, and it is parsed into Stencila Schema nodes.
