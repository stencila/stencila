They can be generated by circadian oscillators, which produce daily rhythms in physiology and behavior, as well as by developmental oscillators such as the segmentation clock, which produces modular developmental units in a periodic fashion. Here, we show that the circadian clock controls the timing of late-stage floret development, or anthesis, in domesticated sunflower. In these plants, what appears to be a single inflorescence consists of up to thousands of individual florets tightly packed onto a capitulum disk. While early floret development occurs continuously across capitula to generate iconic spiral phyllotaxy, during anthesis floret development occurs in discrete ring-like pseudowhorls with up to hundreds of florets undergoing simultaneous maturation. We demonstrate circadian regulation of floral organ growth and show that the effects of light on this process are time-of-day dependent. Disruption of circadian rhythms in floral organ development causes loss of pseudowhorl formation. Thus, we show that the sunflower circadian clock acts in concert with environmental response pathways to tightly synchronize the anthesis of hundreds of florets each day, generating spatial patterns on the developing capitulum disk. This coordinated mass release of floral rewards at predictable times of day likely promotes pollinator visits and plant reproductive success.</span></p></section><section><h1><span>Introduction</span></h1><p><span>From the earliest stages of cellular differentiation to reproductive maturity, spatio-temporal regulation of developmental transitions plays an important role in biological success. In some cases, internal temporal rhythms are used to spatially organize a body plan. For example, in vertebrate embryos a molecular ‘segmentation clock’ acts at regular intervals to divide the developing body axis into discrete blocks of cells that later differentiate into individual somites (</span><stencila-cite target='c43' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Richmond and Oates, 2012</span></stencila-cite><span>). In plants, the regular spacing of lateral roots along the length of the primary root axis is controlled by a ‘root clock’ that generates a temporally oscillating developmental signal (</span><stencila-cite target='c54' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Xuan et al., 2020</span></stencila-cite><span>). Thus in both plants and animals, internal body clocks can generate serially-repeated organs. These types of clocks are distinct from the circadian oscillator, the biological clock found in most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes (</span><stencila-cite target='c34' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Mosier and Hurley, 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). Circadian clocks coordinate development on daily and seasonal time scales. In both plants and animals, the circadian clock can integrate environmental cues such as day length and temperature to time the transition to reproductive stages to the appropriate season (</span><stencila-cite target='c17' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Ikegami and Yoshimura, 2012</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c19' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Inoue et al., 2018</span></stencila-cite><span>). On a diel scale, the circadian clock can coordinate developmental processes with environmental transitions associated with the earth’s rotation, such as leaf movement in plants, eclosion in </span><em><span>Drosophila</span></em><span>, and conidiation in </span><em><span>Neurospora</span></em><span> (</span><stencila-cite target='c6' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Brady et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c23' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Larrondo and Canessa, 2018</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c30' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>McClung, 2019</span></stencila-cite><span>). However, a role for the circadian clock in the spatial patterning of development has not previously been reported.</span></p><p><span>Circadian clocks in eukaryotes are cell-autonomous systems made up of transcriptional-translational feedback loops that create rhythms of gene expression to regulate biological timing. Circadian rhythms, biological processes regulated by the circadian clock, meet several fundamental criteria (</span><stencila-cite target='c42' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Rensing and Ruoff, 2002</span></stencila-cite><span>). First, they are stably entrained to environmental cues. Second, they persist in free running environmental conditions. Third, circadian rhythms are temperature compensated such that they maintain a uniform period over a range of ambient temperatures, in contrast to the general rule that the rate of enzymatic processes changes with temperature. In addition, the circadian clock gates certain biological processes so that responsiveness to environmental cues is time-of-day dependent. For example, studies in humans show the timing of drug treatment can be critical to creating an effective therapeutic response (</span><stencila-cite target='c45' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Ruan et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). A functioning circadian clock whose biological rhythms match that of the environment provides a fitness advantage for many organisms, including plants (</span><stencila-cite target='c12' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Dodd et al., 2005</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c32' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Michael et al., 2003</span></stencila-cite><span>), animals (</span><stencila-cite target='c33' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Miller et al., 2004</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c13' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Emerson et al., 2008</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c49' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Spoelstra et al., 2016</span></stencila-cite><span>), bacteria (</span><stencila-cite target='c37' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Ouyang et al., 1998</span></stencila-cite><span>), and fungi (</span><stencila-cite target='c22' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Koritala et al., 2020</span></stencila-cite><span>).</span></p><p><span>One important way the circadian clock promotes fitness is by controlling timing of reproductive development, for example by allowing organisms to distinguish between the long and short days of different seasons. In plants, the circadian system mediates the effects of day length during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, usually referred to as flowering time (</span><stencila-cite target='c18' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Imaizumi and Kay, 2006</span></stencila-cite><span>). The circadian clock also regulates daily aspects of floral development, for example coordinating daily rhythms in scent emission and floral opening and closing with pollinator activity (</span><stencila-cite target='c57' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Yon et al., 2017</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c19' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Inoue et al., 2018</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c35' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Muroya et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). In addition, the circadian clock is implicated in the uniform eastward orientation observed in mature sunflower plants; this eastward orientation was shown to enhance both male and female reproductive fitness (</span><stencila-cite target='c3' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Atamian et al., 2016</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c10' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Creux et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>).</span></p><p><span>Domesticated sunflower is an excellent model system to study the temporal regulation of floral development. Sunflowers are members of the Asteraceae, a highly successful family comprised of about 30,000 distinct species that are widely dispersed around the world (</span><stencila-cite target='c14' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Funk et al., 2009</span></stencila-cite><span>). Asteraceae are characterized by the arrangement of individual florets together in a complex, compressed inflorescence called the capitulum. Individual florets are arranged on the capitulum disk in spiral patterns, a classic type of phyllotaxis observed in many plants (</span><span>). These phyllotactic spirals, called parastichies, are generated by the precise specification of floral primordia, first at the outer rim and then moving into the center of the capitulum disk (</span><stencila-cite target='c58' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Zhang et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). In domesticated sunflower, specification of the hundreds or even thousands of floret primordia found on a single capitulum takes approximately 10-14 days (</span><stencila-cite target='c28' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Marc and Palmer, 1981</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c38' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Palmer and Steer, 1985</span></stencila-cite><span>), followed approximately 20 days later by the onset of anthesis, or floral opening, of the first florets (</span><stencila-cite target='c24' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lindström and Hernández, 2015</span></stencila-cite><span>). Anthesis of all florets on a capitulum head typically occurs over 5-10 days (</span><stencila-cite target='c48' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Seiler, 2015</span></stencila-cite><span>). Intriguingly, the timing of anthesis does not follow the gradual and continuous pattern of development seen during specification of floret primordia on the developing capitulum (</span><stencila-cite target='c28' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Marc and Palmer, 1981</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c58' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Zhang et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). Instead, discrete developmental boundaries are observed with obvious rings of florets at distinct stages of anthesis (</span><span>). Each ring, or pseudowhorl, undergoes anthesis on successive days. While previous studies examined the effects of hormones and environmental factors on the timing of development of florets within a pseudowhorl (</span><stencila-cite target='c4' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Baroncelli et al., 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c26' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lobello et al., 2000</span></stencila-cite><span>), the mechanisms governing the conversion of the continuous spiral pattern of development seen early in floral development (</span><span>) to the ringlike patterns seen during anthesis (</span><span>) have not been explored.</span></p><figure data-label='Figure 1.' data-caption='[,{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"type":"Strong","content":[{"type":"Text","value":{"string":"(a)"}}]},{"type":"Text","value":{"string":" A sunflower capitulum before onset of anthesis, with obvious clockwise and counter-clockwise parastichies (Pr) of individual florets.

We find that temperature-compensated daily rhythms in development of both male and female floral organs, and the formation of pseudowhorls, persist when flowers are maintained in constant environmental conditions in the absence of light. However, both daily rhythms in development and the formation of pseudowhorls are lost in constant light, with late-stage floret maturation occurring continuously along parastichies. Importantly, the effects of light on floret development are time-of-day-dependent. Together, these data indicate that late-stage floret development is regulated by the circadian clock. We propose that pseudowhorls are produced in response to an external coincidence mechanism, in which developmentally competent florets undergo reproductive transitions only when they receive environmental cues at the appropriate time of day. Our data thus suggest a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development.</span></p></section><section><h1><span>Results</span></h1><section><h2><span>During anthesis the pattern of development changes from continuous to discrete</span></h2><p><span>The phyllotactic spirals of florets, or parastichies, on sunflower capitula represent continuous age-gradients with the first-specified florets on the outside edge of the capitulum (</span><span>) (</span><stencila-cite target='c28' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Marc and Palmer, 1981</span></stencila-cite><span>). Each disc floret is an individual flower with an epigynous ovary that holds a corolla tube of fused petals (</span><span>). Within the corolla tube is the fused anther tube, subtended by five filaments, collectively forming the stamen (</span><span>). Finally, at the center of the floret is the style and stigma (</span><span>), which we will together call the style. Although early floret development occurs continuously across the capitulum, anthesis does not. Local synchronization of floret development at this developmental stage converts the obvious spiral arrangement of florets on immature capitula into a ring-like pattern of pseudowhorls (</span><span> vs </span><span>).</span></p><p><span>Previous studies described daily patterns in sunflower floret anthesis, with a single floret releasing pollen the day before the stigma of this floret is receptive to pollen (Putt, 1940; </span><stencila-cite target='c36' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Neff and Simpson, 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>). Before anthesis all reproductive organs are enclosed within the corolla tube (</span><span>). As anthesis begins, the corolla tubes of multiple florets within a pseudowhorl coordinately rise above the capitulum surface (</span><span>) driven by ovary growth rather than expansion of the corolla (</span><span>, </span><span>). Next, rapid elongation of anther filaments causes anther tube protrusion above the corolla (</span><span>) (</span><stencila-cite target='c4' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Baroncelli et al., 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c26' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lobello et al., 2000</span></stencila-cite><span>). In this staminate stage of anthesis, pollen is released within the anther tube and is then pushed up and out by the rapid growth of the style through the anther tube soon after dawn (</span><span>). Continued style elongation pushes the stigma beyond the anther tube to initiate the pistillate stage of anthesis (</span><span>). This plunger-style mechanism of pollen presentation is an ancestral feature of the Asteraceae family (</span><stencila-cite target='c21' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Jeffrey, 2009</span></stencila-cite><span>). The stigmas then unfold and become receptive to pollen the day after pollen release (</span><span>). The temporal and spatial separation between pollen release and stigma presentation in sunflowers promotes cross-fertilization across head (</span><stencila-cite target='c39' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Patterson, 2009</span></stencila-cite><span>).</span></p></section><section><h2><span>Pseudowhorls are generated by synchronized, daily rhythms in floret development</span></h2><p><span>To better understand the synchronization of anthesis within each pseudowhorl, we characterized the detailed temporal dynamics of late-stage floret development. Plants were maintained in light-dark cycles and constant temperature. Florets within a single pseudowhorl were dissected every 15 – 30 minutes over 24 hours and individual organ lengths measured. Ovary elongation was observed first, starting near the time of lights off and continuing for approximately 10 hours (</span><span>). As previously described (</span><stencila-cite target='c4' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Baroncelli et al., 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c26' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lobello et al., 2000</span></stencila-cite><span>), we found that stamen elongation commenced approximately 8 hours after lights off, driven by an approximately 2.5x increase in anther filament length over 5 hours (</span><span>). Anther tubes, like corolla tubes, did not elongate during this time frame. Stamens reached maximal length at time 28, and later shrank due to filament collapse (</span><span>, </span><span>). Styles initiated rapid elongation one hour after anther filaments, with growth continuing over 11 hours until they reached ∼2x their original length and grew past the stamens. Thus, the obvious discrete phases of anthesis visible on whole capitula (</span><span>) are driven primarily by the consecutive and highly coordinated elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles within each pseudowhorl.</span></p><figure data-label='Figure 2.' data-caption='[,{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"type":"Strong","content":[{"type":"Text","value":{"string":"(a)"}}]},{"type":"Text","value":{"string":" Growth kinetics of floral organs in a single pseudowhorl for plants grown in LD|25°C with dark from ZT 16-20.5.

We used time-lapse movies of sunflowers undergoing anthesis taken at 15-minute intervals and scored observable patterns of growth as proxies for the detailed organ measurements described above. We first examined growth kinetics in capitula undergoing anthesis in long-day conditions reminiscent of a summer day (16 hours light, 8 hours dark, and constant 25°C (LD|25°C (16h:8h)). A new pseudowhorl of florets underwent anthesis every 24 hours, with ovary swelling initiating in the late night, stamen elongation visible from late night to soon after dawn, and conspicuous style elongation occurring in the latter part of the day and early night (</span><span>; </span><span>; Video 1). Times of ovary, stamen, and style growth were highly coordinated across pseudowhorls and flowers (</span><span>). The mean midpoint of visible ovary growth occurred before dawn at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 22.9 (with the time of lights on defined as ZT 0), followed by the mean midpoint of stamen growth at ZT 1.3, and the mean midpoint of style growth before dusk at ZT 12.6 (</span><span>; </span><span>). Similar experiments were carried out for plants exposed to shorter (LD|25°C (12h:2h)) or longer (LD|25°C (19.5h:4.5h)) photoperiods. Similar daily rhythms of anthesis were observed in all three conditions, with the phases of organ growth relative to dawn changing only slightly with different night lengths (</span><span>; </span><span>). In all three photoperiod conditions, the timing of floret development within pseudowhorls was highly coordinated (</span><span>; </span><span>).</span></p><p><span>This high degree of developmental coordination within each pseudowhorl is quite remarkable given that the initiation of floret primordia along a parastichy occurs continuously over many days (</span><stencila-cite target='c58' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Zhang et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). We therefore examined the timing of ovary, stamen, and style growth within a pseudowhorl along separate parastichies (</span><span>). While the number of florets per parastichy in a pseudowhorl varied, growth of the three different organs occurred at almost the identical time for all florets (</span><span>). Ovary lengths were also measured along individual parastichies at ZT 2, a time when ovary growth within a pseudowhorl is complete (</span><span>). The lengths of ovaries within a pseudowhorl along a parastichy were similar to each other (</span><span>, </span><span>), but there was a large step-down in length compared to ovaries of pre-anthesis florets in the same parastichy. Previous studies showed the large changes in ovary size and filament length during anthesis are due to rapid cell expansion (</span><stencila-cite target='c25' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lindström et al., 2007</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c24' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lindström and Hernández, 2015</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c26' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Lobello et al., 2000</span></stencila-cite><span>).

To investigate whether constant light also affected other aspects of flower development, we entrained sunflowers in LD|25°C (16h:8h) and then transitioned them to constant light and temperature (LL|25°C) on the first day of anthesis. As expected, no stamen growth was observed (</span><span>; </span><span>; Video 3). Ovaries and styles did elongate, but initiation occurred continuously across the capitulum. Instead of the coordinated floret anthesis seen along a parastichy of florets in LD|25°C (16h:8h) (</span><span>), in LL|25°C florets showed a continuous, age-dependent pattern of anthesis (</span><span>; </span><span>; Video 3). Consistent with continuous rather than discrete developmental transitions across the capitulum in constant light, ovary length along a parastichy showed a size gradient dependent on the age of the floret (</span><span>). Thus, in constant light conditions the timing of anthesis mirrors the continuous pattern of floret specification seen very early in capitulum development.

We next investigated whether temperature cycles could rescue daily rhythms of floret anthesis in constant light (LL|30°-18°C (16h:8h)). Although anther filament growth was not restored, the addition of thermocycles to constant light coordinated the onset of ovary and style growth so that pseudowhorls formed (</span><span>; </span><span>, </span><span>; </span><span>). Scoring of individual florets along a parastichy also showed that anthesis was coordinated into discrete pseudowhorls in constant light with thermocycles (</span><span>; </span><span>). As expected, this generated a discontinuous change in ovary length along parastichies from post-anthesis florets in a pseudowhorl to pre-anthesis florets (</span><span>). Thus, temperature cycles restore some daily anthesis rhythms and thereby rescue pseudowhorl formation.</span></p></section></section><section><h1><span>Discussion</span></h1><p><span>Many aspects of floral physiology, including flower opening and scent production, vary across a day (</span><stencila-cite target='c5' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Bloch et al., 2017</span></stencila-cite><span>). In a few cases, such as petal opening and closing in </span><em><span>Kalanchoë blössfedliana</span></em><span> and flower movements in </span><em><span>Nicotiana attenuata</span></em><span>, the circadian clock has been shown to regulate these diel rhythms (</span><stencila-cite target='c8' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Bünsow, 1953</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c56' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Yon et al., 2016</span></stencila-cite><span>). Here, we show that daily rhythms in the development of floral organs in sunflower persist in constant environmental conditions, are temperature compensated, and exhibit a time-of-day specific response to environmental cues (</span><span>, </span><span>, </span><span>). We therefore conclude that the circadian clock controls floral development in sunflower to ensure release of pollen soon after dawn and the emergence of styles and stigmas late in the day. Although style elongation is largely complete near the end of the first day of floret anthesis (</span><stencila-cite target='c4' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Baroncelli et al., 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>) (</span><span>), stigmas do not become receptive to pollen until the following morning (Putt, 1940; </span><stencila-cite target='c36' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Neff and Simpson, 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>). This temporal separation between release of pollen and stigma receptivity is thought to reduce self-pollination and is prevalent throughout the Asteraceae family (</span><stencila-cite target='c21' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Jeffrey, 2009</span></stencila-cite><span>).</span></p><p><span>We found that elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles are all under circadian regulation, but respond differently to environmental cues. For example, transfer to constant light caused a complete inhibition of anther filament elongation, significantly slowed ovary expansion, but had no significant effect on style elongation (</span><span>). In contrast, transfer to constant darkness slowed style elongation considerably but had only modest effects on growth of ovaries and anther filaments (</span><span>; </span><span>). The strong inhibition of style elongation in constant darkness may help explain why rhythms in style emergence were less robust than those of ovary and anther growth in this condition (</span><span>). Responses of the different organs to temperature were also distinct: temperature cycles slowed ovary expansion and had no effect on anther filament growth in either constant darkness or light; however, temperature cycles slowed style elongation rates in constant darkness but not constant light (</span><span>). These results are consistent with our previous field studies that showed modest changes in ambient temperature affected style but not anther filament elongation (</span><stencila-cite target='c10' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Creux et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). Overall, the different sensitivities of floral organs to light and temperature suggest they may be regulated by distinct growth regulatory pathways. This is consistent with studies in other plants, which revealed that different hormones regulate the growth of male and female reproductive organs (</span><stencila-cite target='c9' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Chandler, 2011</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c29' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Marciniak and Przedniczek, 2019</span></stencila-cite><span>).</span></p><p><span>While the molecular pathways controlling elongation of anther filaments and styles in sunflower are likely different, we demonstrate that their common regulation by the circadian clock results in the fast and near-synchronous release of pollen a few hours after dawn. Intriguingly, many bee- and butterfly-pollinated Asteraceae species release pollen in the morning (</span><stencila-cite target='c7' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Budumajji and Raju, 2018</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c16' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Hipólito et al., 2013</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c36' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Neff and Simpson, 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c50' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Valentin-Silva et al., 2016</span></stencila-cite><span>) while at least one bat-pollinated member of the family releases pollen in the early night (</span><stencila-cite target='c2' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Amorim et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). Since the precise timing of pollen release relative to dawn affects male reproductive success in sunflower (</span><stencila-cite target='c10' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Creux et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>), it is tempting to speculate that clock regulation of late-stage floret development may be widespread in the Asteraceae. Identification of the mechanisms by which the circadian system coordinates the growth of male and female floral organs to promote timely pollen release will be of great interest.</span></p><p><span>The ecological and evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family, estimated to contain ∼10% of angiosperm species, is attributed in part to their compressed inflorescences that act together as single false flowers to attract pollinators (</span><stencila-cite target='c27' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Mandel et al., 2019</span></stencila-cite><span>). In sunflowers, the individual disk floret primordia are first initiated on the outer perimeter of the very large, flat head meristem and subsequent primordia are initiated following a centripetal pattern to generate the characteristic spiral pattern of immature florets seen across the disk (</span><span>, </span><span>) (</span><stencila-cite target='c28' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Marc and Palmer, 1981</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c38' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Palmer and Steer, 1985</span></stencila-cite><span>). Recent experimental and modeling studies in gerbera daisies attributed formation of this spiral pattern to short-range interactions between spatially close initia (</span><stencila-cite target='c58' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Zhang et al., 2021</span></stencila-cite><span>). In contrast, our work suggests that the ringlike pattern of pseudowhorls that emerges during anthesis (</span><span>, </span><span>) is generated by the action of the circadian clock on florets across the capitulum disk, with loss of synchronized daily rhythms in anthesis in constant light and temperature leading to loss of pseudowhorl formation (</span><span>).</span></p><p><span>How do florets of different developmental ages temporally coordinate anthesis to generate pseudowhorls? We propose that a type of external coincidence model is at work, analogous to the mechanisms underlying photoperiodic control of the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in many plants (</span><stencila-cite target='c40' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Pittendrigh and Minis, 1964</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c55' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Yanovsky and Kay, 2003</span></stencila-cite><span>). In our model, developmentally competent immature florets respond to a period of darkness that falls during the subjective night and is at least 4.5 hours long by undergoing the growth events that lead to anthesis (ovary expansion followed by the rapid onset of anther filament and then style elongation) (</span><span>). This is conceptually similar to photoperiodic control of flowering in short day plants such as rice, in which light at night inactivates a clock-regulated transcription factor that promotes the transition to flowering (</span><stencila-cite target='c20' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Izawa et al., 2002</span></stencila-cite><span>). However, we speculate that local signals also contribute to the coordination of floret anthesis across the capitulum disk. Imposition of dark treatments during the subjective day delayed anthesis by close to 24 hours (</span><span>; </span><span>), until normal rhythmic patterns of anthesis resumed after entrainment to the new light conditions. However, pseudowhorls that developed subsequent to these delays contain the same number of florets as those found on plants that did not experience delays (</span><span>). This suggests that signaling may occur between florets in adjacent pseudowhorls to control the onset of anthesis. This might be a positive cue from post-anthesis florets to promote development of the next pseudowhorl, or a negative cue from pre-anthesis florets to inhibit development of nearby florets (</span><span>).</span></p><p><span>Plants are generally considered diurnal organisms and often have more robust circadian rhythms in constant light than in constant darkness (</span><stencila-cite target='c31' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Michael et al., 2008</span></stencila-cite><span>). We were therefore surprised to find robust rhythms of anthesis in conditions of constant temperature and darkness but not constant temperature and light (</span><span>, </span><span>). This is similar to conidiation rhythms in </span><em><span>Neurospora crassa</span></em><span>, which are observed in constant darkness but not in constant light (</span><stencila-cite target='c46' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Sargent et al., 1966</span></stencila-cite><span>). An interesting question for further study is whether in constant light sunflower floret rhythms are present but masked, or whether the floral circadian clock is arrhythmic in this condition. The very rapid resetting of the different phases of organ growth to new light conditions (</span><span>) suggests the latter may be true.</span></p><p><span>Another interesting question is why florets of different developmental ages undergo coordinated anthesis to generate pseudowhorls. It has been reported that the foraging activity of both honeybees and native bees on sunflower heads is positively correlated with the number of florets undergoing anthesis at any given time, and that seed set is strongly correlated with the number of bees foraging on heads (</span><stencila-cite target='c11' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>DeGrandi-Hoffman and Watkins, 2000</span></stencila-cite><span>; </span><stencila-cite target='c36' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Neff and Simpson, 1990</span></stencila-cite><span>). In the case of the highly social honeybees, hive members communicate via a dance language to quickly reallocate the numbers of foragers sent to different food sources based on resource availability (</span><stencila-cite target='c51' citation-mode='Parenthetical'><span>Visscher and Seeley, 1982</span></stencila-cite><span>). We therefore speculate that the coordinated release of floral rewards by the hundreds of florets undergoing anthesis within a pseudowhorl each morning may be a mechanism to enhance attractiveness to pollinators and thus promote reproductive success.</span></p></section><section><h1><span>Materials and Methods</span></h1><section><h2><span>Sunflower Floret Development Imaging and Scoring</span></h2><p><span>Sunflower seeds of HA412 HO (USDA ID: PI 603993) genotype were planted into small pots of soil (Sunshine Mix #1, Sun Gro Horticulture) and germinated with a plastic lid in a PGV36 growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) at 25°C with 16 hours light (provided by metal halide and incandescent lamps, 300 μmol m</span><sup><span>-2</span></sup><span> s</span><sup><span>-1</span></sup><span>) and 8 hours darkness per day.

For ovary growth measurements, at ZT 2 on after the second day in a given growth condition, entire florets, including ovaries, were dissected from the capitulum along 4-8 continuous parastichies and photographed. Ovary length was then measured with Image J for each floret, consecutively. Position 8 always designated the boundary between pseudowhorls.</span></p></section></section></article></body></html>
