# Introduction

Antarctic penguins serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health and climate change impacts in the Southern Ocean, making their morphological characteristics of particular interest to researchers. The three brush-tailed penguin species of the Palmer Archipelago - Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Gentoo (P. papua), and Chinstrap (P. antarcticus) - exhibit distinct physical traits that have evolved through adaptation to their specific ecological niches, providing valuable insights into their evolutionary history and ecological roles.

# Methods

```python exec
import pandas as pd

penguins = pd.read_csv("penguins.csv")
```
