        In September 2017 eLife announced the start of the Reproducible Document
        Stack (RDS) project, a collaboration between Substance, Stencila and
        eLife to support the development of an open-source technology stack
        aimed at enabling researchers to publish reproducible manuscripts
        through online journals. Reproducible manuscripts enrich the traditional
        narrative of a research article with code, data and interactive figures
        that can be executed in the browser, downloaded and explored, giving
        readers a direct insight into the methods, algorithms and key data
        behind the published research.

        , based on one of Errington’s papers in the Reproducibility Project:
        Cancer Biology. This reproducible version of the article showcases some
        of what’s possible with the new RDS tools, and we invite researchers to
        explore the newly available opportunities to tell their story.
