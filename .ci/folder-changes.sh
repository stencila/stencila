# Script used to create a list of folders that have changes in
# them compared to a base.
#
# If on `master` branch then the latest tag is the base.
# If on another branch then `master` branch is the base.
#
# If on `master` then use the default two dots.
# On a branch used three dots so that get the differences
# starting at the last common commit (in case master has had commits
# in the meantime).
# See https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/git_diff_dots.html
#
# Used by `azure-pipelines.yml`.

# On CI, we may be in "detached HEAD" state so
# use `git rev-parse` instead of `git branch` to
# determine if on master.
