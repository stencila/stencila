# Python and Stencila

## üëã Introduction

This folder groups the python code for the Stencila project.
The code is organized in the following folders:

- `stencila_types`: Python types generated from the schema-gen crate, and associated shortcuts and utilities. This package is required by the following two packages.
- `stencila`: This rust-extension for python (using pyo3) that exposes some of the core Stencila API to python.

See the individual folders for more information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Develop

We use [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/latest/) for managing dependencies.
Installation instructions are [here](https://pdm-project.org/latest/#installation).

We develop using the lowest version of Python that is supported by Stencila, which is Python 3.10.
You will need a copy of Python 3.10 installed on your system where `pdm` can find it (using `asdf`, `pyenv`, or `conda`, or a system installation).
`make install` in this folder, or the subfolders will create a virtual environment for each of the packages.

## Release

This is currently manually done for the python packages.

We use the [pdm-bump](https://github.com/carstencodes/pdm-bump) plugin to bump versions.
After installing `pdm`, run the following to install pdm-bump:

```bash
pdm plugin add pdm-bump
```
