# Machine Learning Applications in Data Analysis

# Introduction

This content should remain because it follows the title heading. The author bylines above should be removed by RemovePrePrimary, the first heading should become the document title, and this Introduction heading should be converted to a section.

# Methods

This section should also be properly structured as a section element.

# Results

The final section should be wrapped in a section element as well.
