structuring:
- text-to-citations
- paragraphs-to-sentences
---

This tests that citations remain intact when paragraphs are split into sentences. This interaction is important because sentence boundaries must not break citation groups and abbreviations like Dr. must not cause incorrect splits that damage citations.

According to Smith (2023), machine learning shows promise. However, Dr. Jones and Prof. Wilson (2022) disagree with this approach. Multiple studies (Brown et al. 2021; Davis 2020; Wilson & Taylor 2019) support the original findings.

The paragraph above should be split into sentences while preserving the citation structures: "Smith (2023)", "Dr. Jones and Prof. Wilson (2022)", and the citation group "(Brown et al. 2021; Davis 2020; Wilson & Taylor 2019)". The abbreviations "Dr." and "Prof." should not cause incorrect sentence splits.
