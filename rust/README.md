# Stencila Rust

**Core Stencila functionality implemented in a fast, memory-safe language**

## ü¶Ä Introduction

This is the `stencila` core Rust library. Its main purpose is to implement core functionality that can be reused in the Stencila CLI and in language bindings.

## üì¶ Install

This library is not yet published to https://crates.io/, but you can still add it to your `Cargo.toml` using,

```toml
stencila = { git = "https://github.com/stencila/stencila" }
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Develop

### Getting started

Get started by cloning this repository, [installing Rust](https://rustup.rs) and using the using `make setup` to install necessary Cargo plugins (for formatting, linting, etc) and linkers:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stencila/stencila
cd stencila/rust
make setup
```

This project is configured to use fast linkers to significantly improve build times:

- **Linux**: [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold)
- **macOS**: [lld](https://lld.llvm.org/)

The `make setup` command automatically installs the appropriate linker for your platform. See the `setup-linker` recipe in the `Makefile` if you would prefer to do this yourself.

If you are contributing code please run formatting, linting and tests before submitting PRs:

```sh
make fix test
```

### Code organization

This library is made up of many Rust crates. Splitting Rust code into small crates has advantages for compilation speed, modularization and reuse. In addition, because Rust derive macros must be in their own crate, and to avoid circular dependencies among crates it it necessary to split some crates further (e.g the `codec-html`, `codec-html-derive`, and the `codec-html-trait` crates).

Most of these crates are internal and are not published (those crates have `version = "0.0.0"` in their `Cargo.toml`).

The current crates include (but are not limited to):

#### CLI

- [`cli`](cli): The `stencila` CLI tool

- [`cli-gen`](cli-gen): Generates reference documentation for the CLI

#### Documents and formats

- [`document`](document): A document representing one of the `CreativeWork` types in the Stencila Schema.

- [`format`](format): Provides the `Format` enum and utility functions for working with document formats.

#### Schema

- [`schema-gen`](schema-gen): Generates language bindings, JSON Schema definitions and documentation from the Stencila Schema.

- [`schema`](schema): Rust types generated from the Stencila Schema by `schema-gen`

#### Node traits

- [`node-store`](node-store) and [`node-store-derive`](node-store-derive): Provides the `ReadNode` and `WriteNode` traits and derive macros for reading and writing document nodes from/to Automerge stores.

- [`node-strip`](node-strip) and [`node-strip-derive`](node-strip-derive): Provides the `StripNode` trait and derive macro for removing properties of document nodes.

#### Codecs

- [`codec`](codec): Provides the `Codec` trait for encoding/decoding between the types in the `schema` crate and other external formats (i.e. a 'converter').

- [`codec-losses`](codec-losses): Utilities for recording encoding/decoding losses.

- [`codec-debug`](codec-debug): A codec for the Rust [`Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) trait.

- [`codec-html`](codec-html): A codec for [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

- [`codec-jats`](codec-jats): A codec for [JATS XML](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/).

- [`codec-json`](codec-json): A codec for [JSON](https://json.org/).

- [`codec-json5`](codec-json5): A codec for [JSON5](https://json5.org/).

- [`codec-markdown`](codec-markdown): A codec for Markdown.

- [`codec-text`](codec-text): A codec for plain text.

- [`codec-yaml`](codec-yaml): A codec for [YAML](https://yaml.org/).

#### Utilities

- [`common`](common): Common dependencies used across crates.

- [`common-dev`](common-dev): Common development dependencies used across crates.

### Using Tokio console

Turn on the `console-subscriber` feature to use [`tokio-console`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) for debugging async tasks and locks e.g.

```console
cargo run --bin stencila --features=console-subscriber -- serve
```

and in another terminal run `tokio-console`,

```console
tokio-console
```
