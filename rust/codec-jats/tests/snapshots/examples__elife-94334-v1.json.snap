While activation of the DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest is well understood, how it is maintained remains unclear. To address this, we conditionally depleted key DDC proteins after the DDC was fully activated and monitored changes in the maintenance of cell cycle arrest. Degradation of Ddc2"

Dun1 is required for the establishment, but not the maintenance, of arrest, whereas Chk1 is required for prolonged maintenance but not for initial establishment of the mitotic arrest. When the cells are challenged with two persistent DSBs, they remain permanently arrested. This permanent arrest is initially dependent on the continuous presence of Ddc2, Rad9, and Rad53; however, after 15 hr these proteins become dispensable. Instead, the continued mitotic arrest is sustained by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins Mad1, Mad2, and Bub2 but not by Bub2’s binding partner Bfa1. These data suggest that prolonged cell cycle arrest in response to 2 DSBs is achieved by a handoff from the DDC to specific components of the SAC. Furthermore, the establishment and maintenance of DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest require overlapping but different sets of factors."

To investigate how conditional depletion of DDC or SAC proteins alters the maintenance of cell cycle arrest, we engineered a yeast strain that permanently arrests due to the presence of two persistent DNA breaks. We find that the maintenance of the cell cycle arrest requires constant presence of some, but not all, checkpoint activation proteins. Surprisingly, we find that the DDC proteins that are essential to induce the cell cycle arrest and sustain it at the early stages of the arrest become dispensable nearly 15 hr after DNA damage induction. Conversely, SAC proteins are dispensable for the establishment and the initial steps of the cell cycle arrest but become essential at later stages of the DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest. Based on these findings, we posit that prolonged cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage is sustained by both SAC and DDC; however, each checkpoint sustains the arrest at different stages."

After the DNA damage checkpoint is established, its maintenance proves to be divided into two distinct phases. Arrest up to about 15 hr requires the constant presence of most of the identified DDC proteins, including Ddc2, Rad9, Rad24, and Rad53, with Dun1 playing an important but nonessential role. Although Chk1 was not required either to establish or initially to maintain cell cycle arrest, its absence shortened arrest, most notably when Rad53 was depleted. Surprisingly, neither Ddc2, Rad9, nor Rad53 (and we suggest likely Rad24) are necessary for the prolongation of cell cycle arrest lasting longer than 15–24 hr. Instead, this prolonged arrest is enforced by SAC proteins Mad1, Mad2, and Bub2."
