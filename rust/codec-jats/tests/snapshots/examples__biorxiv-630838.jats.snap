    <abstract>
      <p>Cells under high confinement form highly polarized hydrostatic pressure-driven, stable leader blebs that enable efficient migration in low adhesion, environments. Here we investigated the basis of the polarized bleb morphology of metastatic melanoma cells migrating in non-adhesive confinement. Using high-resolution time-lapse imaging and specific molecular perturbations, we found that EGF signaling via PI3K stabilizes and maintains a polarized leader bleb. Protein activity biosensors revealed a unique EGFR/PI3K activity gradient decreasing from rear-to-front, promoting PIP3 and Rac1-GTP accumulation at the bleb rear, with its antagonists PIP2 and RhoA-GTP concentrated at the bleb tip, opposite to the front-to-rear organization of these signaling modules in integrin-mediated mesenchymal migration. Optogenetic experiments showed that disrupting this gradient caused bleb retraction, underscoring the role of this signaling gradient in bleb stability. Mathematical modeling and experiments identified a mechanism where, as the bleb initiates, CD44 and ERM proteins restrict EGFR mobility in a membrane-apposed cortical actin meshwork in the bleb rear, establishing a rear-to-front EGFR-PI3K-Rac activity gradient. Thus, our study reveals the biophysical and molecular underpinnings of cell polarity in bleb-based migration of metastatic cells in non-adhesive confinement, and underscores how alternative spatial arrangements of migration signaling modules can mediate different migration modes according to the local microenvironment.</p>

      <title level="1">Introduction</title>
      <p>Cancer cell migration plays a crucial role in invasion and metastasis, which is often fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). During metastasis, tumor cells migrate through their surrounding microenvironment, navigating various tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) geometries, including confined spaces, to spread to distant sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). For cells to undergo motility, they must establish spatial polarity to create an actomyosin architecture that generates protrusion in the direction of migration, adhesion to the microenvironment, traction forces to move the cell relative to the environment, and retraction of the cell rear to make forward progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Tumor cells can employ several distinct modes of migration, which are influenced by their interactions with their particular microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Depending on the availability of adhesion ligands, cancer cells can dynamically switch between integrin-mediated mesenchymal migration and adhesion-independent amoeboid migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In integrin-dependent migration, ECM ligand binding induces signaling that drives actin polymerization-based protrusions including lamellipodia and filopodia, and utilizes integrin-ligand binding and integrin linkages to the cytoskeleton to drive adhesion and traction generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, when ECM ligand is unavailable or integrin signaling is suppressed, metastatic tumor cells fail to make actin-driven protrusions and instead switch to ameboid migration in which they adopt a bleb-driven mode of protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In bleb-based migration, hydrostatic pressure causes a directional bubbling out of the plasma membrane from the actin cortex in the direction of migration, and non-specific friction with the confined microenvironment together with actomyosin-driven cortical flow of transmembrane proteins drives adhesion and traction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Blebbing is associated with increased Rho activity and is particularly pronounced in confined spaces, where high Rho-mediated contractility and elevated hydrostatic pressure from the confinement lead to the formation of large blebs that facilitate persistent migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Despite these observations, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying bleb-based migration in confined environments remain unclear.</p>
      <p>While it is reasonably well understood how cell polarity is established during mesenchymal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), how this is achieved during bleb-based ameboid migration is largely unknown. Establishment of polarity requires symmetry breaking, which can occur in response to asymmetric cues, including diffusible molecules like during chemotaxis, substrate-bound signals as in haptotaxis, and physical cues as in mechanotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). In the absence of such directional cues, cells may spontaneously break symmetry due to cytoskeletal instabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). However, such cytoskeletal asymmetry must be reinforced and maintained by polarized signaling within the cell. For instance, in adhesion-based mesenchymal migration, integrin engagement with an ECM gradient activates local Rac1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) that generates branched actin-driven lamellipodial protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) that have primed integrin receptors at their tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), thus reinforcing protrusion and adhesion in a specific direction. In addition, in mesenchymal chemotaxis, growth factor gradients result in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation at the cell front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). This initiates a cascade of locally self-amplifying signaling events through PI3K, resulting in accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and Rac or Cdc42 activation to promote formation of branched or bundled actin protrusions at the cell front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Simultaneously, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) and Rho GTPase activity at the cell rear drive formin-based actin bundle formation and myosin II activation, generating traction and rear retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In contrast, cells migrating via bleb formation in high confinement undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), where loose formin-based actin bundles form just proximal to the bleb tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) and dense actin networks, along with myosin II activation, dominate the rear of the bleb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This asymmetry in polymerization and contraction drives cortical actomyosin flow within the bleb, which when coupled to transmembrane proteins that generate friction on the tightly confined microenvironment, propels the cell forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). However, the role of polarized receptor signaling in reinforcing polarity in the absence of integrin engagement in bleb-based migration remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
      <p>One system for maintaining polarized cellular asymmetries is by spatial regulation of receptor signaling on the plasma membrane. Establishment and maintenance of spatially constrained domains of transmembrane receptors in the fluid plasma membrane can occur through multiple mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is by advective movement along with membrane or cortical flows driven by membrane tension gradients or by direct or indirect binding to flowing cortical actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), as occurs during establishment of body-axis polarity in the early C. elegans embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Alternatively, regions of specific plasma membrane composition can be formed by local addition or removal of surface proteins by spatial regulation of endo- and exocytosis, as occurs in maintenance of apical and basal-specific ion channels and transporters in polarized kidney epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) or like in<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>ovary, where RTK signaling is spatially restricted to distinct regions of migrating border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Finally, local surface receptor compartmentalization can also be mediated by polarizing endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) or spatial restriction of receptor lateral mobility within the plasma membrane, also known as “corralling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). For instance, during phagocytosis, large transmembrane proteins, such as Cluster of Differentiation 44 (CD44), limit the diffusion of Fcγ receptors by corralling at the rear of polarized macrophages, leaving them more mobile at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Whether these mechanisms govern establishment of stable polarity in bleb-based migration is yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanisms that mediate the cell polarization that enables persistent bleb-based migration of metastatic cancer cells in non-adhesive confined microenvironments. Our previous work demonstrated that leader bleb-based migration in metastatic melanoma cells under confinement is driven by Erk signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), which is linked to EGF/EGFR/Ras/Raf pathways. We thus hypothesized that the polarized distribution of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling components, such as phosphoinositides and Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), is required for maintaining persistent polarized migration in metastatic melanoma cells under confinement. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an<italic>in vitro</italic>cell confinement assay together with time-lapse high resolution imaging and optogenetic control of local signaling to dissect the mechanisms mediating the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity during bleb-based migration. We find that bleb-based migration occurs via spatial constraint of similar signaling modules utilized to drive polarity in lamellipodium-based chemotactic migration, only these modules are largely spatially inverted. Whereas in lamellipodial migration growth factor receptors and downstream PI3K-Rac signaling localize to the cell front, we find their localization to the bleb rear is required to maintain bleb stability and persistent migration. We further reveal that this rear-to-front EGFR gradient is established by restricting mobility of EGFR in the plasma membrane at the rear of the bleb by CD44 interacting with cortical actin via the linker protein ezrin. Our results thus identify a novel mechanism by which restricting EGFR-PI3K-Rac signaling axis to the back of the bleb results in rapid migration of cancer cells that may be critical to their highly invasive behavior in vivo.</p>

        <p>Here we sought to understand the highly polarized bleb morphology of metastatic melanoma cells migrating in a confined, non-adhesive microenvironment. We first asked if this morphology was functionally relevant to cell migration. We performed time-lapse imaging of A375M2 human metastatic melanoma cells that were held in non-adhesive confinement to 3 μm height using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cellular confinement device, mimicking the degree of tissue confinement observed during metastasis<italic>in vivo</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). We then characterized the relationship between cell morphology and motility. Melanoma cells confined in a non-adhesive environment exhibited blebs that were typified by distinct states of morphology and stability (). This included a minor population (∼9 percent) of cells that exhibited small transient round blebs around their peripheries with a lifetime of less than a minute ((, top row, 1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Confinement also induced elongated blebs (, rows 2-4), as described for many cell types from different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>

        <p>Quantitative analysis showed that cells with elongated blebs could either be in a non-polarized state with multiple elongated blebs around their peripheries (∼13 percent) or in a highly polarized morphology with a single elongated bleb (∼75 percent) (). Cells with single elongated blebs exhibited two distinct types that we will refer to as dynamic elongated blebs (), which were those that extended and retracted with a lifetime of &lt;25 minutes (∼35 percent) and leader blebs, which were stable and had a lifetime of &gt;25 min (∼40 percent of cells; , B; Movie 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). To determine if different bleb morphologies were functionally relevant to migration, we analyzed motility parameters for each category of cell shape in confinement. We found that cells exhibiting stable leader blebs migrated much more efficiently compared to cells exhibiting round transient blebs, multiple elongated blebs, or a dynamic elongated bleb, displaying significantly greater migratory range, as measured by a greater slope on a mean squared displacement over time plot (), migration persistence () and higher diffusion coefficient (). Indeed, plotting the lifetime of elongated blebs before their retraction vs either their migration persistence () or diffusion coefficient () showed significantly positive correlations. In contrast, similar analysis of bleb lifetime vs speed showed that cells with an elongated bleb moved at similar speeds, independent of bleb lifetime ( and ). These results show that stabilization and maintenance of a polarized, elongated, leader bleb morphology is critical to efficient and persistent migration of metastatic melanoma cells in non-adhesive confinement.</p>
        <p>We then sought to investigate the molecular basis underlying stabilization of highly polarized leader blebs in melanoma cells in non-adhesive confinement. As sensing of soluble growth factors in the microenvironment is critical to cell polarization in directional, adhesion-based migration of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), we probed the role of serum components and growth factors in leader bleb polarization and stability. We observed that confinement of serum-starved A375M2 cells resulted in a strong decrease in formation of stable leader blebs and increased the fraction of cells with round transient blebs compared to cells confined in serum-containing media (, G). Analysis of cell motility parameters showed that serum starvation strongly reduced migratory range () and the few cells that exhibited leader bleb morphology had reduced migration persistence, but no effect on cell speed (, J). As EGF signaling is critical to cell migration and developing drug resistance in metastatic melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and starvation causes downregulation of this signaling (), we reasoned that EGF could be the serum factor responsible for promoting leader bleb-based migration in non-adhesive confinement. Importantly, addition of EGF to serum-starved cells partially rescued the leader bleb morphology (, bottom panel and ; Movie 2) and increased the migratory range and migration persistence (, 1I) but did not impact the cell speed (). We found that pharmacological inhibition of either EGFR tyrosine kinase activity using erlotinib (10μM) or inhibition of its downstream target phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pi3K) with wortmannin (10nM) strongly decreased the proportion of cells with stable leader blebs ( and ; Movie 3) and their migratory range (). Furthermore, those cells that did make leader blebs under either treatment showed significantly reduced migration persistence (), without a change in migration speed (). To substantiate the notion that EGF signaling promoted persistent leader bleb-based migration in non-adhesive confinement, we examined the effects of knocking down the EGF receptor by siRNA (EGFR-KD, ). This showed that compared to non-targeting siRNAs (NT), EGFR-KD strongly inhibited the formation of both dynamic and stable elongated blebs (, 1J; Movie 4J) and significantly reduced cell migratory range (). Though the EGFR-KD cells exhibiting leader bleb morphology had both reduced migration persistence () and speed (), these did not rise to statistical significance. Together, these results show that EGF signaling through PI3K is required for stabilization and maintenance of a polarized, elongated leader bleb morphology to drive persistent migration and promote migratory range under non-adhesive confinement.</p>

        <title level="2">EGFR, PI3K, and Rac1 activities exhibit rear-to-front gradients in leader blebs</title>
        <p>We next focused on understanding how EGF signaling mediates stabilization of the polarized morphology of elongated blebs during migration of melanoma cells under non-adhesive confinement. We examined the localization of EGFR by expressing EGFR-GFP and super-resolution confocal imaging. This revealed that a strong gradient of EGFR-GFP was present along the plasma membrane of leader blebs with a very low concentration at the distal bleb tip that rose to a peak at about a quarter of the length from the bleb base, and remained elevated at the neck where the bleb connects to the cells body (). Quantification of the polarity index across the bleb confirmed this rear-to-front gradient, with the bleb base exhibiting an average ∼2.5 fold enrichment of EGFR-GFP compared to the bleb tip (). This surprising rear-to-front polarity of EGFR on leader blebs led us to ask whether the localization of activated EGFR differed from that of the total EGFR, i.e. if there was a local difference in sensitivity to EGFR activation within the bleb. To approach this question, we utilized a modular biosensor in which the C-terminus of EGFR is fused with a tyrosine activation motif from CD3, such that when EGFR signaling is high, this motif is phosphorylated, resulting in the selective recruitment of the SH2 domain of ZAP70 (ZtSH2) to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Live imaging of cells co-expressing fusion red-labeled EGFR-CD3 (EGFR-CD3-FR) and clover-tagged ZtSH2 (ZtSH2-CLV) showed that both constructs formed strong rear-to-front gradients very similar to that seen for EGFR-GFP, indicating that EFGR activity is concentrated at the base of the leader bleb (, 2E). Quantification of the ratio of ZtSH2-CLV to EGFR-CD3-FR showed that while there appeared to be a slight elevation in the fraction of activated receptor towards the bleb tip, the polarity index of the ratio was close to zero, indicating that there was no spatial bias in sensitivity of EGFR (, 2G). Taken together, these results show that EGFR localization and activity are highly polarized in a rear-to-front gradient in leader blebs during migration in non-adhesive confinement.</p>

To examine the subcellular localization of PI3K signaling, we expressed either a fusion of the PH domain of Akt with GFP (Akt-PH-GFP) as a bio-sensor for phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) or a fusion of the PH domain of PLC-delta with GFP (GFP-C1-PLCdelta_PH) to report on phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), and imaged cells by confocal microscopy ().</p>
        <p>Imaging and measurement of polarity index within leader blebs showed that, similar to EGFR and its activity proxy, Akt-PH-GFP (PIP3) exhibited a strong rear-to-front gradient with high intensity at the base of the bleb and low levels at the tip (, left panel, 2I). In contrast, PLC-delta-PH-GFP (PIP2) revealed a front-to-rear gradient the inverse of that of PIP3, with highest concentration at the tip of the leader bleb (, right panel, 2I). As PI3K signals to Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and PIP2 on the plasma membrane recruits RhoA and its regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), we examined the localization of Rac1 and RhoA activities within leader blebs. We expressed the GTP binding domains (GBD) of either Pak fused to YFP (Pak-GBD-YFP) or Rhotekin fused to GFP (Rhotekin-RBD-GFP), which act as GTP-dependent binding sensors for Rac1 or RhoA, respectively. Confocal imaging showed that similar to EGFR-GFP and Akt-PH-GFP, Pak-GBD-YFP, and thus Rac1 activity, concentrated at the base of the bleb in a rear-to-front gradient (, left panel, 2K). In contrast, like PLC-delta-PH-GFP, Rhotekin-RBD-GFP, and thus RhoA activity, localized toward the bleb tip ( right panel, 2K). Overall, these results show that cells undergoing migration in non-adhesive confinement spontaneously polarize EGFR in the plasma membrane of the leader bleb to generate strongly localized regions of subcellular signaling, with EGFR downstream effector PI3K promoting PIP3 accumulation and Rac1 activity in rear-to-front gradients, and their antagonists, PIP2 and RhoA activity, localized to the bleb tip. Furthermore, this rear-to-front polarization of signaling in leader blebs in non-adhesive confinement is totally opposite to the canonical front-to-rear polarization of the same factors in directional, adhesion-dependent mesenchymal migration.</p>

        <title level="2">Rear-to-front gradients of EGFR and Rac1 activities are required for leader bleb stabilization</title>
        <p>We next examined the requirement for the observed rear-to-front gradient of EGF activity and downstream signaling in maintaining leader bleb stability during migration in non-adhesive confinement. To approach this, we first asked whether the degree of EGFR polarization correlated with bleb morphology or stability. We analyzed bleb aspect ratio as a function of EGFR-GFP polarity index along the bleb for either transient elongated blebs or stabilized leader blebs (). This showed that although bleb aspect ratio did not appear to correlate with EGFR polarity for either transient or stable elongated blebs, stable leader blebs generally exhibited greater EGFR polarity than transient elongated blebs (). Furthermore, we found that even if transient blebs had a high aspect ratio, they did not have a high polarity index (). Direct comparison of EGFR polarity index for transient elongated blebs versus stabilized leader blebs confirmed this, with leader blebs showing significantly higher EGFR polarity than transient blebs (). These results show that a strong rear-to-front gradient of EGFR is associated with leader blebs, and suggests that this gradient may be required for their stabilization.</p>

        <p>To determine the requirement for a rear-to-front EGFR gradient in stabilization of leader blebs, we employed an optogenetic approach to change the localization of EGFR signaling within single cells during migration in non-adhesive confinement. We utilized Opto-EGFR, which consists of fusions between the cytosolic domain of EGFR, a myristoylation-based membrane localization tag, the FusionRed fluorescent protein, the intrinsically disordered domain of FUS, and the photolyase homology domain of<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>Cry2 to allow reversible, blue light-induced clustering and trans-phosphorylation of the cytosolic domains to mediate spatial control of EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Cells were transfected with either Opto-EGFR or EGFR fused to fusion red (EGFR-FR) and a galvanometric mirror was used to locally expose a 25 × 40 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) area of the leader bleb tip to repeated pulses every 2 sec of 405nm laser light to locally induce clustering of Opto-EGFR ().Time-lapse imaging showed that light exposure on the bleb tip in cells expressing Opto-EGFR caused a significant decrease in leader bleb length after 25 min compared to similar light exposure on the bleb tip of cells expressing EGFR-FR (). These results show that mis-localizing EGFR signaling to the tip of leader blebs causes bleb retraction, and strongly support the notion that the existing rear-to-front gradient of EGFR activity is required for leader bleb stability.</p>
        <p>We then asked whether the asymmetric distribution of Rac1 activity in the rear of the bleb is required for leader bleb stability. We utilized an optogenetic Rac1 construct (PA-Rac) which consists of Rac1 fused to the photoreactive light oxygen voltage (LOV) domain from phototropin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), such that 488nm light relieves LOV domain steric hindrance to allow Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Repeatedly delivering 488 nm light pulses every 4 sec to a 5 μm diameter circle near the tip of the bleb in cells co-expressing PA-Rac and FusionRed F-tractin (F-tractin-FR) was sufficient to decrease bleb length (), cause local disassembly of the actin bundles that reduced actin coherence at the bleb tip (, 3G, Movie 5), drive assembly of lamellipodial actin protrusions (), and eventually retract the blebs (). This was compared to the lack of actin remodeling or retraction in response to similar light exposure at bleb tips in cells expressing the non-photoactivatable control (PA-Rac450A) (). Together, these results suggests that spontaneous polarization of EGFR localizes downstream signaling to activate Rac1 at the rear of the leader bleb, and this asymmetric distribution of signaling is required for bleb stability to drive persistent migration in non-adhesive confinement.</p>

        <title level="2">Rear-to-front EGFR gradient is maintained by local restriction of EGFR mobility near the bleb base</title>
        <p>We next approached the question of the physical mechanism by which the rear-to-front gradient of EGFR is formed and stabilized within leader blebs in cells migrating in non-adhesive confinement. Maintenance of an asymmetric distribution of trans-membrane proteins that can diffuse in a lipid bilayer could be controlled in several possible ways, including: Localized protein turnover within the membrane by spatially restricted insertion and/or removal by exo- and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>); advective movement driven by direct or indirect interaction with the flow of the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) ; or local restriction of free mobility (diffusion and bulk membrane flow) via membrane “corralling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). We began by ruling out the first hypothesis, which is supported by the fact that leader bleb cells under confinement have their secretory and endocytic apparati localized almost exclusively in the cell body and do not extend into the bleb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). We further validated this assumption by photobleaching EGFR-GFP throughout the entire bleb and analyzing the recovery pattern by time-lapse imaging (). This showed that recovery was very slow () and occurred directionally from the cell body (, Movie 6), with no localized bursts of EGFR-GFP anywhere along the length of the bleb that would be indicative of exocytosis of EGFR-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>).</p>

        <p>An important insight gained from initial consideration that EGFR and membrane synthesis occur the cell body is that both bulk membrane and EGFR must both undergo a net anterograde movement from the bleb base towards the tip (See Supplementary text). This was surprising, and in opposition to the notion that advective movement via retrograde cytoskeletal flow would mediate the formation of the rear-to-front EGFR gradient.</p>
        <p>We thus explored the possible contribution of advection by actin retrograde flow in forming the EGFR gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We first characterized actin dynamics in leader blebs to obtain parameters for our model. Time-lapse super-resolution confocal microscopy and particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of F-tractin-FR ( and ) showed, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), that actin retrograde flow was slow at the bleb tip (∼-5 μm/min), high in the middle (∼-6.5 μm /min), and slower again at the bleb base (, 2K; Movie 7). Modeling the effect of this actin retrograde flow profile on EFGR distribution produced a rear-to-front gradient of EGFR, similar to the measured distribution. Increasing or decreasing the actin retrograde flow speed changed the slope of the gradient (), suggesting that an EGFR gradient could potentially be established by cytoskeletal advection, as has been suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). To test this experimentally, we perfused leader bleb cells expressing F-tractin-FR and EGFR-GFP with the actin stabilizing drug, jasplakinolide, to inhibit the actin treadmilling that drives retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) (, Movie 8). PIV analysis confirmed that jasplakinolide strongly hindered actin retrograde flow along the leader bleb compared to DMSO control (, C). Surprisingly, however, analysis of EGFR localization showed that inhibition of actin flow did not destroy the rear-to-front EGFR gradient, and had no significant effect on the polarity index of EGFR distribution along the bleb (; Movie 8). These results show that although advection by cytoskeletal retrograde flow could in theory mediate formation of a rear-to-front EGFR gradient in leader blebs, experimental evidence shows that this gradient is not established by actin retrograde flow and is independent of its velocity.</p>
        <p>We then sought to assess the model prediction related to anterograde membrane and EGFR movement from the cell body towards the bleb tip. To experimentally test this, we expressed either EGFR-GFP (, upper panel) or the membrane marker, GFP fused to the CAAX prenylation signal sequence (CAAX-GFP, , lower panel), photobleached them in a stripe near the base of the bleb, and analyzed the directionality of the intensity recovery by determining the position of the minima of an inverted Gaussian fitted to the bleach stripe over time (). This analysis showed that photobleached stripes in either EGFR-GFP or CAAX-GFP exhibited anterograde movement from the bleb base towards the tip ( and ; Movie 9), but with different apparent velocities with CAAX-GFP moving significantly faster than EGFR-GFP (). Taken together, these results support the notion that EGFR present in the bleb plasma membrane originates by a net anterograde movement from the cell body towards the bleb tip, and that EGFR movement is somehow slowed relative to that of the bulk membrane.</p>
        <p>We then explored what type of membrane association caused EGFR to resist anterograde membrane flow and accumulate at the bleb rear to form a rear-to-front gradient. We analyzed the distribution of different types of membrane-associated markers within the leader bleb, including other transmembrane proteins (Gt46-GFP or LAT-GFP (an artificial secretory protein containing a signal sequence, GFP, a consensus N-glycosylation site, the transmembrane domain of the LDL receptor, and the cytoplasmic tail of CD46), an inner leaflet-associated marker (CAAX-GFP), or an outer leaflet-associated marker (GFP fused to glycosylphosphatidylinositol, GPI-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Imaging and analysis of polarity index of these markers in leader blebs showed that, similar to EGFR-GFP, the transmembrane proteins LAT-GFP and Gt46-GFP formed rear-to-front gradients, accumulating towards the base of the bleb. In contrast, the inner and outer leaflet membrane markers CAAX-GFP and GPI-GFP were evenly distributed along the bleb (, 4J). These results suggest that transmembrane proteins are capable of resisting anterograde membrane flow to mediate their accumulation in rear-to-front gradients along the leader bleb.</p>
        <p>We next pursued the question of how transmembrane proteins resist anterograde membrane flow. We modeled the effect of restriction of EGFR mobility relative to that of the bulk membrane by “corralling” (<italic>E<sub>1</sub>(x)</italic>) but, while considering minimal advection by retrograde actin flow (<italic>hence E<sub>2</sub>(x) = 0.1</italic>), in line with our experimental observations. Our model showed that implementing different corralling and hence different EGFR restriction levels in the leader bleb membrane resulted in rear-to front EGFR gradients that decreased steepness with decreasing corralling (). This suggests that local restriction of EGFR mobility could allow the protein to resist anterograde membrane flow and cause its accumulation in a rear-to-front gradient.</p>

        <p>We next sought to determine the molecular basis of mobility restriction of EGFR to maintain the EGFR gradient along leader blebs. As CD44 and ERM (Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin) proteins are known to link to the sub-membrane cortical actin meshwork to create membrane corrals that restrict free diffusion of transmembrane proteins in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), we examined their distributions in leader blebs. Immunostaining for CD44 and ezrin in confined cells revealed a concentration of CD44 and an absence of ezrin in the cell body, but both proteins formed rear-to-front gradients within leader blebs (). Similarly, leader blebs in cells expressing CD44-GFP () in non-adhesive confinement showed an asymmetric localization with a high concentration at the rear of the bleb that decreased towards the tip (). To determine if cells undergoing bleb-based migration in more physiologically-relevant confined microenvironments exhibited similar protein organization, we assessed by immunostaining the distribution of CD44 and EGFR in melanoma cells migrating in a 3D fluorescently-labeled collagen fibril matrix. 3D confocal imaging showed that in collagen matrices, melanoma cells formed leader blebs in which CD44 and EGFR formed rear-to-front gradients (). Thus, the corralling proteins CD44 and Ezrin localize in a similar rear-to-front gradient as EGFR in leader blebs in cells undergoing confined migration.</p>
        <p>We next examined whether actin organization was conducive to corral formation in leader blebs by analyzing actin architecture and proximity to the bleb membrane. Analysis of actin filament organization showed that actin coherence was low towards the bleb base, indicating a dense actin meshwork, and increased towards the bleb tip where filaments formed bundles (, 3B). To determine if the actin meshwork was in close proximity to the plasma membrane, we utilized a biosensor consisting of the actin-binding domain of inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate 3-Kinase A fused to citrine fluorescent protein and the CAAX prenylation signal sequence (MPAct-citrine) such that the sensor diffuses freely in the membrane except in regions where cortical actin is within ∼10 nm from the plasma membrane, where it becomes immobilized and enriched by binding actin, thus marking membrane-proximal actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). Analysis of MPAct-citrine within leader blebs revealed that membrane-proximal actin was predominantly located at the rear of the bleb (, 3D).</p>

        <p>Together, these results show that CD44 and Ezrin are concentrated at the rear of leader blebs where the actin cortex forms a dense meshwork in close proximity to the membrane, suggesting these components could form membrane corrals that locally restrict the mobility of EGFR in cells migrating in confined microenvironments.</p>
        <p>We next tested the requirement for CD44 and ERM proteins in restricting EGFR mobility by cytoskeletal corralling to maintain the EGFR rear-to-front gradient in leader blebs. We first tested if EGFR mobility correlated with CD44 localization. We performed FRAP to simultaneously bleach small regions near both the bleb base where CD44 concentration is high and at the bleb tip where CD44 is largely excluded, and analyzed their intensity recoveries over time (; Movie 11). This showed that EGFR-GFP intensity recovery at the bleb base was significantly slower than at the bleb tip, indicating a locally reduced mobility of EGFR in the region of CD44 concentration (, 6C). We then tested the requirement for CD44 in forming the EGFR gradient and restricting its mobility in the plasma membrane. Cells were co-transfected with EGFR-GFP and either CD44 pooled siRNAs (CD44-KD) or non-targeting (NT) control and subjected to non-adhesive confinement (). Analysis showed that CD44-KD caused flattening of the EGFR-GFP rear-to-front gradient and significantly skewed the polarity index towards zero compared to NT control (). FRAP experiments and analysis for spots bleached near the bleb base showed that reducing CD44 levels caused significantly faster recovery compared to NT control, confirming that CD44 reduces the mobility of EGFR-GFP (, 6G and 6H; Movie 12). We next tested the involvement of CD44’s link to the extracellular glycocalyx in maintaining the EGFR gradient by treating cells expressing EGFR-GFP in non-adhesive confinement with hyaluronidase (HAase) to degrade polyhyaluronic acid. We found that, compared to DMSO controls, hyaluronidase treatment had no significant impact on the EGFR-GFP rear-to-front gradient or polarity index in leader blebs ( and ). As A375M2 cells predominantly express ezrin and moesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>), we silenced their expression with pooled siRNAs (EM-KD) and assessed the effects on EGFR distribution. This showed that, like CD44-KD, EM-KD flattened the EGFR-GFP gradient along the leader bleb and significantly skewed the polarity index towards zero (, 4D). Importantly, neither CD44-KD nor ezrin-KD caused changes to the organization of actin at the rear of the bleb ( and ). Thus, CD44 and ERM proteins are required for restricting the mobility of EGFR near the bleb base to maintain the EGFR back-to-front gradient during leader bleb-based migration.</p>

        <p>We next asked how CD44 is maintained in a polarized distribution to restrict EGFR mobility at the bleb base. - Examining the evolution of CD44 localization during leader bleb formation () showed that, like EGFR, CD44-GFP accumulated at the base of the bleb and never advanced towards the bleb tip as the bleb elongated, suggesting it was trapped towards the bleb rear (; Movie 13). We then probed the role of ERM proteins in CD44 localization by examining CD44 distribution in leader blebs of EM-KD cells (). This showed that EM-KD altered the distribution of CD44 in leader blebs compared to non-targeting controls ( and ), causing flattening of the CD44-GFP intensity gradient and significantly skewing the CD44 polarity index towards zero (). Taken together, our data demonstrates that ERM proteins promote the polarized distribution of CD44, and together with a membrane-proximal actin meshwork at the rear of the bleb, curtail EGFR mobility as the bleb elongates and to establish a rear-to-front EGFR gradient in leader blebs.</p>

        <p>We finally sought to investigate the importance of CD44-mediated corralling of EGFR mobility at the bleb base in promoting bleb polarity and persistent migration in non-adhesive confinement. We first examined the impact of CD44 depletion on polarity signaling within leader blebs. Analysis of Pak-GBD-YFP in CD44-KD cells showed reduction in the rear-to-front polarization of Rac1 activity in CD44-KD compared to NT controls ( and ). To assess the role of CD44 on leader bleb-based migration we silenced CD44 expression by siRNAs targeting the 3’UTR of CD44 (CD44-3’KD) and compared this to NT controls. This showed that CD44-3’KD significantly inhibited leader bleb formation ( and ; Movie 14) and drastically reduced the migratory range of cells in non-adhesive confinement (). However, cells that managed to undergo leader bleb-based migration exhibited persistent migration with similar velocity ( and ; Movie 15). Notably, reintroducing CD44-GFP into the knockdown cells rescued the percentage of cells undergoing leader bleb-based migration () and restored the migratory range and persistence to levels comparable to NT controls (, ). Together, our results show that during non-adhesive confinement, melanoma cells protrude elongated blebs that trap CD44 at their base due to its interaction with the underlying actin cortex via ezrin, that in turn restricts EGFR mobility to mediate polarized signaling within the bleb to stabilize bleb morphology and promote persistent leader-bleb based migration ().</p>

      <p>Cells with high contractility under confinement form hydrostatic pressure-driven blebs, enabling efficient migration in low-adhesive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Our study reveals the molecular basis for maintaining polarity in metastatic melanoma cells migrating in non-adhesive confinement, showing that confinement-induced pressure promotes a persistent, highly polarized stable leader bleb. This stability is achieved through an asymmetry in actin polymerization at the bleb leading edge and contractility at the bleb rear, coupled with actin retrograde flow, which creates a feedback loop that sustains the polarized morphology in the absence of any external chemical cues or integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). We investigated the basis of the polarized bleb morphology of metastatic melanoma cells migrating in confined, non-adhesive environments. Our findings reveal that EGF signaling via PI3K stabilizes and maintains a polarized leader bleb for efficient migration.</p>
      <p>Using high-resolution microscopy and biosensors, we observed a unique rear-to-front gradient of EGFR/PI3K activity, promoting PIP3 and Rac1 accumulation at the bleb rear, with its antagonists PIP2 and RhoA concentrated at the bleb tip. Optogenetic experiments showed that mislocalizing EGFR and Rac1 activities causes bleb retraction, underscoring the role of this signaling gradient in bleb stability. Mathematical modeling and experiments identified a mechanism where, as the bleb initiates, CD44 and ERM proteins restrict EGFR mobility in a membrane-apposed cortical actin meshwork in the bleb rear, establishing a rear-to-front EGF-PI3K-Rac gradient. Thus, our study reveals the biophysical and molecular underpinnings of cell polarity in bleb-based migration of metastatic cells in confined microenvironments ().</p>
      <p>This study reveals a striking polarization of signaling within leader blebs in metastatic melanoma cells under confinement that is the reverse of the classical model of cell polarity seen in mesenchymal migration. In integrin-dependent mesenchymal migration, ECM engagement activates integrin-PI3K-Rac1 signaling at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>), promoting Arp2/3 mediated, branched actin polymerization-driven protrusion of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), while Rho GTPase coordinates activation of myosin II contractility in the cell center and rear that drives actin retrograde flow at focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>), acting as a regulatable molecular clutch by mediating transient interactions between actin and ECM-bound integrins to drive cells forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). By contrast, we observed a reversed polarity in bleb-based migration in non-adhesive confinement, with EGFR-PI3K-Rac signaling localized at the bleb rear and activated RhoA concentrated at the bleb leading edge. How does this<italic>reversed</italic>signaling polarity drive forward movement in leader bleb-based migration? We suggest that the Rho-GTP activity we documented at the bleb tip likely mediates formin-dependent assembly of actin bundles observed at the leading edge, in line with recent work showing that mild formin inhibition halts actin nucleation at the bleb tip and retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). However, since leading edge protrusion in bleb-based migration is driven by pressure, the branched actin network that is believed to be evolved for generating membrane pushing forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>) is not needed. But leading edge actin assembly is still required for bleb based migration in order to feed continuous retrograde flow along the bleb length to sweep transmembrane, cytoskeleton-associated proteins rearward to mediate the non-specific friction with the substrate that drives the cell forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Why leading edge Rho activity does not promote contractility at the bleb tip is not clear, as myosin II filaments have been shown to assemble at the bleb midpoint and grow into ribbons as they contract and flow rearward with the dense actin meshwork at the bleb rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The transition from actin bundles at the bleb tip to meshwork at the bleb rear is likely mediated by the spatial switch between leading edge Rho activity to EGFR-PI3K-Rac1 signaling to activate Arp2/3-mediated actin meshwork assembly at the bleb rear. Furthermore, Rac1 has been shown to drive myosin II filament assembly at focal adhesions in mesenchymal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>), and in the absence of integrin signaling, may mediate myosin II assembly in the bleb rear to pull actin rearward, disassemble it at the bleb neck, and actively deplete actin from the cell front to maintain blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). This spatial reorganization of Rho-GTPases and PI3K signaling may allow metastatic cancer cells to use the same basic motility building blocks in a different organization to shift from adhesion-dependent mesenchymal migration to bleb-based, adhesion-independent migration under confinement, creating distinct types of protrusions suited to varying environments.</p>
      <p>Our study identifies CD44 as critical for maintaining polarity and bleb stability in metastatic melanoma cells, in line with its high expression at tumor fronts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). CD44 depletion reduces blebbing and contractility, implying a role in myosin activation at the bleb rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). One mechanism may involve ligand-dependent activation, where CD44 binds hyaluronan or matrix metalloproteinases to recruit Rho-GTPases, activating myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>).</p>
      <p>Alternatively, our findings suggest that CD44 acts as a transmembrane “picket”, to corral EGFR, via an ezrin and actin meshwork, at the bleb rear, where lower receptor density at the front limits activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). This configuration could form a feedback loop as growth factor signaling promotes downstream ERM protein phosphorylation, linking CD44 to actin. Although hyaluronan degradation didn’t alter EGFR polarity in our experiments, this mechanism might vary in the tumor microenvironment. Our data reveal that CD44 restricts EGFR diffusion across the bleb, impacting its spatial distribution. Additionally, changes in the cytoskeletal network during the bleb cycle affect diffusion, with denser actin during bleb retraction aiding myosin II-driven retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), potentially engaging more transmembrane “pickets” to redistribute EGFR signaling and regulate bleb dynamics during bleb-based migration.</p>
      <p>The spontaneous polarization of metastatic melanoma cells in the absence of chemical or haptotactic gradients, coupled with their efficient migration in confined, low-adhesion environments, has important implications for tumor invasion and metastasis. Previous studies have shown high Erk signaling in melanoma cell blebs, likely due to localized, restricted signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). High contractility can increase the invasive potential of cancer cells, confer anoikis resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>), and promote drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). How common these phenomena are across different solid tumors and how they change with disease progression remain important areas for further exploration.</p>

The device consists of a pressure cup, a confiner coverslip affixed with micro-pillars and a glass bottom dish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The height of the micropillars determined the height for the spatial confinement of the cells between the coverslip and the substrate, which was 3 microns in this study. The confiner coverslips were sonicated in PBS, air dried under the hood. The glass bottom dishes (Fluorodish, 35mm, FD3510-100) and the confiner coverslips were plasma-treated for 1 min, incubated with 0.5 mg/mL pLL-<italic>g</italic>-PEG (SuSoS, PLL(20)-g[3.5]-PEG(2)) in 10 mM pH 7.4 HEPES buffer for 1h at room temperature. Confiner coverslips and glass-bottom dishes were rinsed briefly with PBS and incubated in cell culture medium for at least 2 hours before confining the cells. Prior to confinement, cells were trypsinized (Tyrpsin-EDTA 0,25%), washed, and collected in a pellet by brief centrifugation at 3,000 rpm and resuspended in warm DMEM with FBS (without phenol red) and then plated on glass bottom dishes that were pre-treated with PLL-g-PEG and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and was then placed on the microscope. The confiner cover slip with pillars attached to the confiner suction cup was then lowered over the sample and attached with low pressure seal sufficient for attachment to the glass dish but insufficient for confinement of the cells. Confinement was initiated slowly by increasing the pressure utilizing the custom software (4Dcell) to control the vacuum pump.</p>

        <p>Cell confinement for immunostaining was performed under agarose slabs. Agarose slabs for cell confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) were made by boiling 750mg of ultrapure agarose (Life Technologies) added to 50 ml of DMEM without phenol red and pouring 1 ml directly in a fluorodish (35mm, FD3510-100). After gelation, a hole was punched in the agarose using a small biopsy needle. Prior to confining, 1 ml of 1% BSA made in DMEM was added to the agarose slabs and was left to equilibrate and coat overnight. Before use, media with BSA was thoroughly aspirated and 100μl of media containing cells were pipetted below the agarose pad by gently lifting the pad slightly from the empty hole. The remaining media was thoroughly vacuumed out of the punch hole. To prevent drying, the dish was sealed using parafilm and was incubated for 1 hour in the incubator. After an hour, the immunostaining was performed using the protocol described below.</p>

Time duration required for a bleb cycle (nucleation, elongation, persistence and retraction) was noted as the bleb lifetime. Small round blebs with lifetime less than 1 minute were categorized as transient blebs. Other blebs with a lifetime more than 1 minute and which were cylindrical in shape were categorized as elongated blebs. Lengths of the elongated blebs were measured for each time point when the bleb existed in the image frame using the segmented line function in Fiji by drawing regions of interest (ROI) manually. Cells with multiple such blebs were categorized as multiple elongated blebs, and polarized single large blebs were further grouped into dynamic elongated bleb (with a bleb cycle of less than 25 minutes) or leader blebs (with a bleb cycle of more than 25 minutes).</p>
