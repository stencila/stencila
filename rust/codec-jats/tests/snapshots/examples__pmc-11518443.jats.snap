        <p>The intense childrearing years often coincide with the heightened work demands and responsibilities of the career-building years. We aimed to evaluate the association between family-life stage and men’s and women’s experience of work and private demands, and the conflict between these demands.</p>

        <p>We evaluated 3532 mothers and 731 fathers as part of the Portuguese population-based birth cohort Generation XXI (2018-2020). Data on family-life stage (exposure), work demands, private demands, and work-to-family conflict (outcomes) were retrieved at the 13-year follow-up wave, as well as data on sociodemographic and household characteristics. Family-life stage was operationalized according to the age of the youngest child: stage 1 (≤5 years), stage 2 (6-11 years), and stage 3 (≥12 years). Ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate associations.</p>

        <p>Men reported more frequently long working hours, while women spent more time on household and child-related tasks. After adjustment for parents’ and household characteristics, mothers and fathers with younger children were more likely to report spending more time on child-related tasks (ORmothers = 1.83; 95%CI 1.44, 2.33; ORfathers = 2.36; 95%CI 1.41, 3.94), compared to those with older children. Fathers with younger children were also more likely to report spending more time on household tasks (OR = 2.20; 95%CI 1.30, 3.73 for routine tasks and OR = 1.75; 95%CI 1.03, 2.97 for sporadic tasks). Mothers exhibited a significant association between family-life stage and time-based work-to-family conflict when they had younger children (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.05, 1.47 for family-life stage 2 and OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.00, 1.63 for family-life stage 1).</p>

        <title level="1">Conclusions</title>
        <p>Both fathers and mothers with young children experienced increased private demands, but only mothers experienced work-to-family conflict. This reveals that family and working arrangements remain marked by a gendered pattern against women.</p>
