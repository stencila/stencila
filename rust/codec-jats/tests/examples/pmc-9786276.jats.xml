          >Monopterus</italic> crawls by body undulations in a serpentine or sidewinding technique, the latter of which was not previously observed beyond snakes. The other 3 fish genera walk by body oscillations using stiff appendages as propulsors. When they are located anteriorly, as the serrate operculum in <italic

          >Channa</italic> is suggested as the closest extant model for terrestrial locomotion at the fish&#8208;tetrapod transition. The major difference is that the metalocomotor propulsor in <italic

          >Channa</italic> is represented by the anal fin, while in tetrapodomorphs by the pelvic fins. The sprawled pelvic fins were advantageous in respect of reduced requirement for side&#8208;to&#8208;side tail swinging.</p>

          >Modern amphibiotic fishes use various walking techniques but are smaller in length than half a meter, whereas extinct tetrapodomorph fishes of Devonian ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 m. Could they walk out of water, and how did they walk if they could? This study argues that, in recent ichthyofauna, snakehead is most appropriate for modeling walking technique of tetrapodomorph fishes, and provides calculation that their size was at the upper limit for a walking fish.

        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        <p
        >In the middle of the 20th century, an evolutionary scenario, that ancestors of tetrapods have ventured out on land in a fish state and became proper tetrapods in the course of further improvement of terrestrial locomotion, became well established (e.g. Romer &amp; Byrne <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0050"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >1931</xref>; Westoll <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0064"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >1943</xref>; Romer <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0049"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >1958</xref>; Schmalhausen <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0051"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >1968</xref>). According to this scenario, the paired fins, that is, webbed limbs of a fish, transformed into legs, that is, digitate limbs of a tetrapod, to travel between pools of water in a dry season faster. There was though an alternative point of view, that digitate limbs could have been formed while the ancestors were still fully aquatic (Eaton <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0022"
          ref-type="bibr"

Based on the anatomy of early tetrapods and the functional demands associated with aquatic walking, it is unclear whether the locomotor repertoire of early tetrapods was in fact limited to aquatic walking.&#8221; This argument brings us back to the classic concept that digitate legs were formed under full gravitational load, for walking outside water. Thus, first steps on land should have been made on fin&#8208;shaped limbs.

        >Ichthyostega</italic> as employing vertical, not lateral, flexibility in the quasi&#8208;lumbar region (since it does not have a fully formed ribcage, the true lumbar region is not differentiated from the thorax). In their opinion, such spinal flexibility was meant to help <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >Ichthyostega</italic> to move on land by &#8220;inchworm shuffling&#8221; like a seal. In reality, the terrestrial gait of modern seals is a highly reduced gallop, and the gallop is the specific fast&#8208;running gait of therian mammals. If we are to continue with mammal analogy, we need to take into account the fact that, in mammals, taller spinous processes of vertebrae are indicative of reduction of vertical flexibility of the spine. The spinous processes serve as lever arms for an interspinous ligament and the taller they are the more restriction for the ventral flexion of the spine is provided by this ligament. According to classification of mammalian running types suggested by Gambaryan (<xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0026"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >1974</xref>), carnivores, with low spinous processes, have the <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >dorsomobile</italic> gallop, while ungulates have tall spinous processes and thus their gallop is <italic
          toggle="yes"

          toggle="yes"
        >Ichthyostega</italic> had tall spinous processes similar in height to those of massive ungulates, in respect of the vertical spinal flexibility they should be polar opposites. This is one of the reasons, why reconstruction of terrestrial locomotion of <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >Ichthyostega</italic> by analogy with a seal approaches science fiction. Nevertheless, an apparent ichnologic evidence of antiquity of the &#8220;inchworm shuffling&#8221; in tetrapods is presented by track field discovered in Zache&#322;mie Quarry, Poland (Nied&#378;wiedzki <italic

        <p
        >Zache&#322;mie ichnologic field is represented by hundreds of rounded pits. Their considerable depth indicates that, if they were footprints, an animal's body was not entirely submerged in water and its weight was not entirely balanced by buoyancy. Generally, the mosaic of pits is random, but in some places, their groups look like a single imprint of a digitate paw or like an ordered trackway of several footprints. Importantly, the 2 types of order are nowhere combined together, that is, there is no trackway composed of digitate footprints. This &#8220;either digits or walking&#8221; feature does not support the tetrapod nature of trackmaker. Two trackway types were distinguished&#8212;the alternating (glide&#8208;reflection symmetrical) trackways and bilaterally symmetrical ones with the left and right imprints forming a pattern similar to bounding gait&#8212;a kind of gallop with 2 contralateral limbs in a pair strictly synchronized, like in a squirrel. This is what could be ascribed to an &#8220;inchworm&#8208;shuffling&#8221;. Such non&#8208;digitate bounding trackways could have been left by an oversized mudskipper (Harris <xref

However, there is a peculiarity of the trackway Muz. PGI 1728.II.16, which contradicts what we know about any tetrapod. The smaller footprints (treated by Nied&#378;wiedzki <italic

Hence, the longer leg should have borne the smaller foot than the shorter one, which is never the case in known tetrapods and can hardly be imagined even theoretically. As to the singular digitate footprints in Zache&#322;mie, they reach very large sizes. The best one (Muz. PGI 1728.II.1) is very large but not the largest. According to the authors' reconstruction, it could be produced by an <italic

        >Ichthyostega</italic> enlarged by a factor of 2.75. What looks impossible in this reconstruction is the imprint of the underside of the knee (popliteal area) which never touches the ground in any walking or running tetrapod. No popliteal impression is found in any other fossil tetrapod footprint. &#8220;Either digits or walking&#8221;, longer limb with smaller foot, and the popliteal imprint are vulnerable spots in the original hypothesis on the tetrapod nature of Zache&#322;mie pits.

        >Fish terrestrial locomotion was classified into 3 types: axial&#8208;based, appendage&#8208;based, and axial&#8208;appendage&#8208;based, depending on groups of muscles, performing the mechanical work&#8212;trunk, fin, or both (Pace &amp; Gibb <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0043"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2014</xref>). Crawling of eel&#8208;shaped fishes as well as tail&#8208;driven leaping of mudskippers is undoubtedly axial&#8208;based. The aforementioned bilaterally symmetrical bound of mudskippers, with the body rigidly kept straight, is an example of appendage&#8208;based locomotion. It is pectoral&#8208;based, to be precise, since pelvic fins provide only passive support. No known cases of pelvic fins performing mechanical work in fish terrestrial locomotion exist today, though they are found among aquatic walkers (Renous <italic

        >et&#160;al</italic>. <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0048"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2011</xref>). A mixed axial&#8208;appendage&#8208;based or axial&#8208;pectoral&#8208;based type of locomotion could be hard to discriminate from the pure axial&#8208;based. For example, Pace and Gibb (<xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0043"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2014</xref>) ascribe it to <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >Clarias</italic>, despite the fact that during walking its pectoral fin spine is immovably locked relative to the trunk. No movement means no mechanical work. The &#8220;muscular motor&#8221; is not the same as propulsive body parts which transmit the motor's force to the substrate. Both of them should be located and taken into account. An attempt to classify propulsors of walking fishes was presented by Renous <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >et&#160;al</italic>. (<xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0048"

        <p
        >Video recording of fish walking is usually performed from above and with little magnification, which allows to obtain data on speed of movement, range of lateral body bending etc. To determine a technique of interaction with substrate, a close&#8208;up video recording, made from the side, from the front, and from behind, not from above, is needed. Also, not every type of substrate is suitable for this purpose. For example, grassy surfaces (Bressman <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >et&#160;al</italic>. <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0010"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2019a</xref>) or a podium with vertical pegs (Ward <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >et&#160;al</italic>. <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0062"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2015</xref>) are most comfortable for forward crawling. Vertical pegs provide a surface to push forward from with either an appendage or with the flank of the body. A flat surface, on the other hand, is more demonstrative when investigating the mechanics of propulsors. To push forward on it, a fish needs to rearrange its weight between parts of its body. Some should be lifted up&#8212;they will become easier to move forward, others should be pressed to the ground; with their help, it would be possible to push forward with a force proportional to the vertical pressure provided. Thus, on such a surface with an appropriate camera angle, the animal will itself show its propulsors. If the substrate is soft enough, it will retain imprints of the propulsive body parts, as was the case with chin imprints left in clay by <italic
          toggle="yes"
        >Protopterus</italic> (Falkingham &amp; Horner <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0024"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2016</xref>). Grass, while providing comfort for the fish forward movement, simultaneously hides its propulsors from observer. Slick and slippery clay may be difficult for the fish to travel, but shows the full extent of its terrestrial locomotion. Additionally it is a more natural substrate, when talking about a model for Devonian water&#8208;land transition, since at the time no grassy surfaces were present and soil in general was not fixed with vegetation (Clack <xref
          rid="inz212599-bib-0012"
          ref-type="bibr"
        >2007</xref>). Barren clay or sandy banks must have been a usual roadway for new land dwellers. For a suitable generalization of main principles of modern fish terrestrial locomotion, it would be more accurate to use the same environment that is at the same time beneficial for researcher.</p>
        <p
        >It is convenient to organize this kind of research in the modern &#8220;epicenter&#8221; of land invasion by fishes, the Southeast Asia. Comparison of terrestrial locomotion of different fishes in one setting was never performed. Therefore, we decided to record video of common Vietnamese walking fishes, concentrating on larger ones, in the same setting with soft clay surface, and with all possible camera angles in order to visualize fish propulsors.</p>

Live fishes were purchased in a village food market in close proximity to Cat Tien national park. In the market, they were sold in accordance with local guidelines on nature conservation and trade. The fishes were kept and subjected to experiments according to regulations of the Bioethics Committee of the Biological Faculty of Lomonosov Moscow State University which sent the author to Vietnam. In the Cat Tien national park, the fishes from the market were kept in a cool bathroom inside trays with fresh water that was regularly changed. Filming set was constructed immediately beside the storage room; fishes were transported there several times a day for up to 3 days after purchase. All specimens were weighed and measured. In total, 7 individuals of <italic

Fishes were placed on the podium, sometimes several together, and were awaited to walk by their own will, but from time to time, it became necessary to gently stimulate them with a thin bamboo twig. Additional recordings were performed in close vicinity of the podium, easily accessible by fishes, on short grass and on compressed dry soil, sometimes even on sand or a cement road.

        >When filming terrestrial locomotion of the 4 genera of fishes, an observation of travel directionality was made as a side effect. Each fish was placed on a podium in a random place and it was impossible to guess in which direction it would start moving (though it was not convenient for video recording). Some started moving in the same direction the head was pointing at the moment of placement; some turned up to reverse direction. All filmed individuals probably have chosen an initial direction at random, but after they started moving, they continued in a more or less straight line. After short natural pauses, fishes resumed their movement in roughly the same direction. Circular movement occurred only in few cases (Supporting video <xref
          rid="inz212599-supitem-0001"
          ref-type="supplementary-material"
        >S1</xref>). When fish escaped from the podium, it was placed back. Often after that, it escaped from the podium in the same direction. The strategy of making an initially random decision and further sticking with chosen direction could be a rational adaptation of mass resettlement from a water pool that became unsuitable for living. However, research of direction selection and maintenance was beyond the scope of this project; it would require quite different experimental protocol and analysis (Bressman <italic

          >C. batrachus</italic> looks more beneficially built for locomotion on land; overall, it is smaller (this implies a more favorable ratio of muscle force to body weight) and its anterior spine of the pectoral fin, which is the main propelling organ, is separated by a notch from other lepidotrichii, while <italic

          >C. gariepinus</italic> has no such gap. However, despite these differences between 2 species, they did not show any pronounced differences in walking performance. Therefore, they are considered together here.</p>
          <p>For <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Clarias</italic>, walking on clay is based on insertion of its pectoral fin spines into substrate. It inserts the left and right spines strictly alternately, which is evident both in video footage (Supporting video <xref
            rid="inz212599-supitem-0001"
            ref-type="supplementary-material"
          >S1</xref>) and in trackways (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0004"
            ref-type="fig"
          >4a</xref>). Between pits, left by pectoral spines on soft clay, a distinct wavy groove is left by tail dragging behind (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0004"
            ref-type="fig"
          >4b</xref>). To be precise, it is left by the anal fin, a rather soft fringe on the ventral side of the tail. A stride starts when the fish swings one pectoral spine forward by bending its trunk in a horizontal plane and abducting the pectoral spine at an almost right angle to the body flank. In this position, the spine is rotated by pronator muscle to a locked position. In this position, it stays locked on a latch throughout the time interval when it performs propulsion against the ground. Worth noting, in basically the same way the fish exposes its pectoral spines to defend from any aggressor, though in that case it abducts and pronates both spines together. While the fish lies with its belly flat on the ground, the pectoral spine abduction occurs in the horizontal plane and cannot reach the ground with its tip. To use it as support, the fish straightens its body with a push of the tail, at the same time rolling to the side on which the pectoral spine is sticking out, thus turning the spine downwards and firmly inserting it into the ground. From this straightened position, its body starts bending again but in the opposite direction. Consequently, the body side which faces the ground becomes concave and the upper side convex. In this position, the trunk raises in a high arc above the ground and is pulled forward towards the inserted pectoral spine. In a maximum bent position, body falls back to the ground, belly down; spine is taken off the latch by a supinator muscle and is adducted to the body flank, while the opposite spine is swung forward. This begins a second half of the locomotor cycle, mirror image of the first one. Rolling the body from position &#8220;belly down&#8221; to one side and then to another is a necessary part of movement on flat ground while using sideways protruding pectoral spines as propulsors. Without rolling, it would be impossible to firmly insert spines into the ground. Tail push is a subsidiary propulsor, while the main propulsion is ensured by the pectoral spine, when the body is already rolled with the respective side towards the ground. This stage of the locomotor cycle includes the highest elevation of the body above the ground and thus is the most energy consuming. All mechanical work is performed by axial muscles of the trunk and tail. Pectoral fins perform no work because the spine, which is in contact with the ground, is held at a fixed angle to the shoulder girdle. Mechanical work is a product of force and motion. Hence, the immobilized pectoral spine can only passively transmit the force, not performing any mechanical work. As to the pelvic fins, <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Clarias</italic> uses them on land only as auxiliary support at rest, to prevent falling from belly to the side. Respiratory movements were usually observed before and after walking.</p>

          >Crotalus cerastes</italic>, commonly known as &#8220;sidewinder&#8221;. This locomotion is based on the same undulating wave, traveling from head to tail. Unlike simple serpentine crawling, this type includes not only wide lateral swings, but also vertical bends, precisely coordinated with them. It results in a body, starting from the head, gradually lifting above the ground and moving to the side, thus the name &#8220;side&#8221;&#8208;winding. Body parts momentarily laying on the ground serve as supports and propulsors, while lifted parts are moved forward without friction (Supporting video <xref

Body weight, being concentrated on supporting areas of the abdominal surface, provides them with additional friction, which in turn allows for sufficient horizontal propulsion even on slippery surfaces. This highly coordinated type of movement is not available for all snakes and was completely unknown outside Serpentes suborder&#8212;neither for Amphisbaenia and legless lizards, nor for legless salamanders and especially not for eel&#8208;shaped fishes (Gans <xref

            ref-type="supplementary-material"
          >S5</xref>). Angle of inclination to the side is variable, but fishes usually prefer greater inclination, especially on a troublesome substrate, such as slippery clay. In this position, the fish inserts its opercular spines into soil and pulls the tail forward by laterally bending its body. Since the body lies more or less on the side, lateral bending of the body raises it above the ground in a high arc. Next, a relaxation stage ensues: with no apparent involvement of muscles, body, by elasticity, returns to a straight pose, traveling slightly forward by inertia of the previous movement. Several propulsions are performed with one operculum; then the fish flops to the other flank. Imprints left by either left or right opercular spines alternate every few steps, creating an asymmetric track, relative to the imprint left by the trunk, which is dragged along on one or the other side (Fig.&#160;<xref

            ref-type="fig"
          >4c</xref>). A strict alternation of left and right supports in each locomotor cycle was rarely observed. In that case, the fish did not fully flop from one flank to another, but gently rolled from side to side. Tail propulsion was not evident. In between moments of being supported by opercular spines, the body could either stop or it could slide forward by inertia saved from the previous opercular propulsion. Pectoral fin on the downward side is abducted from the body at an almost right angle and serves as an auxiliary support; apparently, it could control the angle of body inclination to provide an optimal positioning of opercular spines. In case of a more gentle inclination, a contralateral pectoral fin is also abducted sideways and touches the substrate at the moment of opercular propulsion. Involvement of pectoral fins in locomotion of <italic

          >Anabas</italic> could be roughly compared to training wheels on a child's bicycle. Positioning of pectoral fins on the ground was variable. A lower, that is, postaxial, edge touched the ground, but the fin web could be either supinated or pronated a bit. In case of supination, the fin web touched the ground with its extensor surface; in case of pronation, with flexor surface. When the pectoral fin slipped on a clay surface, it jerked rather sharply in the posterior direction, towards the flank. This indicates that extensor muscles that adduct the pectoral fin are actively helping with propulsion, though their mass and, therefore, mechanical work are significantly inferior to those of axial muscles pulling the tail forward by bending the trunk.</p>

          >This fish walks by lateral bending of its body, not much tilting from the belly&#8208;down position. Thus, the main movement is parallel to the substrate plane, and the body is not raised high above it. Pectoral fin is placed on the ground in an abducted position. At the same time, its web is flexed, so its end is turned anteriorly, and is also supinated, so the pectoral fin web touches the ground with its extensor surface. Locomotor cycle starts with lateral bending of the body to one side in an arc. Pectoral fin on the convex side of the arc is in front in the direction of travel and assumes the abovementioned position. At the caudal part of the arc is the anal fin. It is long anteroposteriorly and composed of spine&#8208;like lepidotrichii, which at this moment actively stand erect and deflect backwards against the travel direction, in a manner of claws (Supporting video <xref

            ref-type="supplementary-material"
          >S6</xref>). After that, the body straightens sharply and lepidotrichii become inserted into clay thus preventing the caudal part of the body from sliding backwards (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0005"
            ref-type="fig"
          >5</xref>). Therefore, they provide a transmission of propulsive force of ground reaction from the substrate to the body. Consequently, the body, when straightening, moves forward with its front end, yawing slightly around the pectoral fin pressed to the ground, which web rotates in place. It is lacking any spines and can only serve as a vertical support on slippery clay. In some individuals, lepidotrichii of pectoral fins were separated by notches, which gives them the appearance of fingers and probably prevents the fins from slipping sideways on clay. After straightening, the body starts bending to the opposite side to start the second step, mirror image of the first. Another pectoral fin is swung forward. Simultaneously, but over the opposite side, the tail goes forward too. The heavy anterior part of the body rests firmly on the ground while the tail goes forward in a slightly raised position. Sometimes, the anal and/or the caudal fins lightly touch the ground in the swing phase, leaving shallow arc&#8208;like smears in their wake (Fig.&#160;<xref

          >Channa</italic> does not leave any other distinct impressions on the ground. There is neither a wavy groove because the tail is not dragged forward but is swung clear off the ground, nor imprints of the pectoral fins, because their pressure on the substrate is small due to the large surface area of the fin web. Position of the points of support of the pectoral fins on the trackway was reconstructed from video recording made from above with a tripod (Fig.&#160;<xref

In every step, propulsion effort comes from the anchoring point of the spiny anal fin to the point of support of the contralateral pectoral fin. In the next step, the sides of propulsor and supporter exchange. Therefore, the whole trajectory of body movement is shaped as a zigzag.</p>

Note that the body moves forward while the tail slips backward turning around the fulcrum. The anal lepidotrichii deflect backward a little from stage 1 through 4, which indicates that their muscles add some mechanical work to the great work of the muscles straightening the body. The deflection of the anal fin is accompanied with the same movement of the dorsal fin which is useless out of water. The anal fin makes propulsion from the left side; so the support is provided by the pectoral fin on the right side, which is invisible here.

At the moment of the anal fin push, the second pectoral fin initially helped the first one, but soon lost contact with the ground, since the body could not rotate around 2 supports at once. As a result, in the smaller individual, each pectoral fin touched the ground twice during a single locomotor cycle, which is odd. One fin got contact with the ground to full extent; another only touched it. The double action of pectoral fins, as evident from the video recordings, was an active propulsion in this smaller specimen of <italic

          >Characteristically, propulsive deflections of the anal fin from the sagittal plane, alternately, to the left and to the right side are always accompanied with deflections of the dorsal fin to the same side. The latter deflections are even easier to notice because the dorsal fin is not hidden under the body. In addition, the dorsal fin shows a greater deflection rage because it does not meet any resistance, while the anal fin props against the substrate. It is clear that the dorsal fin swinging cannot have any use in terrestrial walking. Apparently, the coupled deflection of the dorsal and anal fins to the same side represents a swimming reflex.</p>

          >Ability of any given fish to walk on land was most clearly dependent on a condition in which each specimen was purchased on the market. The most lively specimens covered for up to 2 or 3 m in one race, regardless of which genus they belonged to, or of individual size. Thus, in respect of absolute racing distance measured in, for example, meters, an ability to walk or crawl is roughly the same in all studied genera. At the same time, in respect to relative racing distance measured in body lengths, smaller fishes demonstrated greater ability to move on land. It could be explained by the simple fact that smaller fishes can support their body with ease outside water because of higher surface to volume ratio, which is converted to the ratio of muscle forces to body weight. On the other hand, the greater relative racing distance of smaller individuals may be an argument for a resettlement function of terrestrial locomotion.</p>

          >After walking for 2&#8211;3 m, fishes rested usually for a period longer, than walking time. Apparently, even these short bursts of activity create oxygen debt, forcing the fish to recuperate. An additional argument for this point is the fact that <italic

          >None of the fishes studied shows a pronounced morphological specialization of the locomotor system for traveling out of water. None of them, if it was found as a fossil, could be suspected of being capable of terrestrial locomotion. Our observations, video recordings, and their analysis have led to the conclusion that the locomotor system of fishes as it is does not provide an obstacle to travel on dry land. In other words, every fish has a theoretical ability to travel on land without specific locomotor adaptations. Even an aberrant specimen of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Clarias</italic>, the one lacking pectoral fins, was moderately successful. The only necessary morpho&#8208;physiological condition for fish terrestrial locomotion is the ability to breathe air. So, in the presence of air&#8208;breathing organs, as already stated by other researchers, terrestrial locomotion is not a matter of morphology but of behavior (Bressman <italic

              >Classification can be based on the location of propulsors in front of or behind the common center of mass of the body. Propulsors are the structures which transmit the forward&#8208;directed component of the ground reaction force to the body. They are usually equipped with spines or claws. In respect to propulsor position, no ready terminology is available for fishes, so mammalian one suggested by Gambaryan (<xref

Prolocomotor type was not named in Gambaryan's classification because it is not found in mammals. It was hypothesized for tetrapodomorphs under a figurative name &#8220;front wheel drive&#8221; (Shubin <italic

Propulsor can be a passive structure showing no muscle activity during its propulsive action, or relying upon isometric contraction of its muscles (muscles do not shorten and thus produce force but no work). Herein, &#8220;prolocomotor,&#8221; &#8220;metalocomotor,&#8221; and &#8220;dilocomotor&#8221; will be used as the terms for propulsors, not motors. They will point to anterior or/and posterior position of the body part which transmits the propulsive thrust to the substrate, with no claim on involvement of the propulsive organ in doing mechanical work for forward movement. However, mechanical work of propulsor is not excluded but specified according to the previous paragraph of classification.</p>

          >Some combinations of these classifying parameters are nonexistent. For example, there is no such thing as undulatory appendage&#8208;based locomotion and the entire third paragraph is irrelevant for undulatory locomotion. Let us illustrate the point with a classification of mudskipper locomotion on a flat surface. This fish can travel on land in 2 modes, either by jumping with the help of its tail or by walking with simultaneous movements of pectoral fins (Harris <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >1960</xref>). The first mode can be classified as an oscillatory axial&#8208;based metalocomotor. The second mode is appendage&#8208;based prolocomotor; it cannot be attributed to either oscillatory or undulatory category since the body remains straight. Pectoral fins take on the propulsive role (propulsive force was measured by Kawano and Blob <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2013</xref>), so this mode is classified as prolocomotor. Also, the pectoral fins perform all the mechanical work, since nothing else moves fore and aft&#8212;so it is an appendage&#8208;based locomotion. Pelvic fins and the tail only provide additional support.</p>

          >Anabas</italic> should be classified as axial&#8208;based with only a slight addition of appendage&#8208;based.

          >Anabas</italic> is flattened laterally, it prefers to move lying on its flank&#8212;several locomotor cycles on one side, then several on another and so on. Side alternations are required to recover the muscles of the flank, which grows tired more. In case of prolocomotor propulsion, these are the muscles which pull the tail forward by bending the body. They are located on the flank, which is turned down to face the ground with opercular spines (propulsors). The propulsive flank should be changed every few cycles, by turning over the belly. Changing of sides during a single locomotor cycle was rarely observed; on the contrary, Davenport and Matin (<xref

A completely new assumption could be made, based on this similarity, that the fossil trackway in question could have been produced by an extinct fish whose pectoral extremities were shaped as spines. Members of antiarch placoderm fishes possessing this feature were quite abundant at the time of water&#8211;land transition of tetrapodomorphs and their remains are usually found at the same sites. Their pectoral fin was entirely represented by a spine and could have served as an organ of prolocomotor propulsion similarly to the pectoral fin spine of <italic

          >Clarias</italic> the abduction angle is close to 90&#176;). Therefore, it could hardly be anchored on the substrate by the very tip. Rather, it could be anchored by convex, sharp, and serrate preaxial edge, which, according to the last reconstruction (B&#233;chard <italic

Indeed, on the Trackway II of Genoa River, there are clear elongate indentations alternating at the sides of sinusoidal tail groove. In addition, every indentation is as if mirrored by a smaller pit located at the opposite side of the trackway midline. Warren and Wakefield (<xref

I am suggesting that the former should be recognized as left by propulsive pectoral spine, while the latter by a light contact of the contralateral pectoral spine. This additional support could have helped to stabilize rolling of the body to the other side. One pectoral spine only slightly supported the body tilt and made a smaller pit, while the pectoral spine on the downward&#8208;facing flank took on full body weight and thus left a deeper indentation.

However, it only excludes the pectoral&#8208;fin&#8208;based walking such as observed in mudskippers, but not the axial&#8208;based one. Extant fishes studied herein prove that in the axial&#8208;based walking, the propulsor does not employ its own mobility and can even be locked in appropriate position, like in <italic

A difference of 70 g equals almost a third of that amelic specimen's true weight and almost a quarter of expected normal weight. It is much more than the absent pectoral fins could have weighed. A more plausible explanation for the difference in mass lies in its general body constitution, more slender than normal (Fig.&#160;<xref

          >Channa</italic> does not need to roll the body to stick it into the ground. As a result of such placement of the propulsive organ, walking movements of <italic

Therefore, its terrestrial locomotion can be, based on mechanical work, classified as axial&#8208;based with addition of appendage&#8208;based, and based on propulsion, as metalocomotor with addition of prolocomotor. Summarizing the observations of oscillatory&#8208;walking fishes, they can be arranged in a series by their propulsion type: (1) pure prolocomotor&#8212;<italic

          >Ch. striata</italic> frequently used the contralateral pectoral fins not alternately (as its larger cousins did) but in a couple&#8212;one for main support, the other for additional; every next step, the dominance changed. In regard to this coupling and active retraction of the pectoral fins in contact phase, locomotion of the smaller <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Ch. striata</italic> can be considered approaching the walking technique of mudskippers. However, there are still more differences than similarities. Mudskippers, when they rely on pectoral fins, use both of them for active propulsion equally and exactly in phase with each other and do not bend the body at all. This is the purely appendage&#8208;based prolocomotor type. Contrary to that, locomotion of <italic

          >Channa</italic>, even in the smaller specimen, is axial&#8208;based and predominantly metalocomotor.</p>

The only fundamental difference is that in snakeheads, pelvic fins are displaced forward, as a secondary trait, and are not involved in walking. Therefore, the main metalocomotor propulsion of snakeheads is performed by the anal fin, acting alternately as either the right hind leg or the left hind leg of tetrapods. Technically, terrestrial locomotion of <italic

Accordingly, the former is called primary ventral, the latter primary dorsal. Ventral side muscles are called flexors; dorsal side muscles, extensors. Fin surfaces are sometimes called accordingly&#8212;flexor side and extensor side. Along with 2 surfaces, each fin has 2 ends and 2 edges. Proximal end is rooted in the body; distal is free. From one end to another, a theoretical longitudinal middle axis could be drawn. If the fin is retaining frontal orientation and its longitudinal axis is at a right angle to the body, one edge will be anterior, another posterior. Using the axis as a basis for fin's own coordinate system, the former is called preaxial, the latter postaxial. The more common position of the paired fins in fishes is not at a right angle to the body, but parallel to it, free end turned posteriorly. In that case, preaxial edge becomes lateral and postaxial&#8212;medial, pressed closely to the body, provided that the fin is still kept in the frontal plane with its ventral side facing ventrally.</p>

Thus, it is turned at a right angle to its initial plane&#8212;preaxial edge turned upwards, postaxial downwards, flexor side turned outward, and extensor side inward. Accordingly, flexor muscles are renamed by ichthyologists as abductors (abducting pectoral fin away from the body) and extensor muscles as adductors (adducting it back to the body) (Winterbottom <xref

According to that research, at the beginning of embryonic development, the pectoral fin plane is at an inclination of almost 40&#176; from frontal position with its preaxial edge deflected upwards; later its plane assumes a completely vertical position (as in ray&#8208;finned fishes) and already in adulthood assumes a fully frontal position with preaxial edge turned sideways (as in sharks).

          >When compared to sarcopterygians, actinopterygians possess much less freedom of axial torsion of paired fins&#8212;pronation and supination. In fact, the fin articulation with the girdle not through a single basal element (monobasal sarcopterygian type), but through a series of endoskeletal rays (polybasal actinopterygian type) implies replacement of rotation by unequal flexion/extension of the aforementioned rays. It is quite possible that the inability to use the true rotation in the shoulder joint in modern walking fishes was the reason for emergence, among them, of the observed fascinating variety of the pectoral fin positioning on flat substrate. The preaxial pectoral spine of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Clarias</italic> interacts with the ground with its very end. If the pectoral fin is represented by a non&#8208;spiny wide web, its positioning is not as obvious. As was aforementioned, the typical position of the pectoral fin in ray&#8208;finned fishes is preaxial edge up, flexor side out, distal end backwards (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0007"
            ref-type="fig"
          >7g</xref>). If a fin in such a position is lowered onto the substrate, it meets it with the postaxial edge (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0007"
            ref-type="fig"

            ref-type="fig"

In the polybasal fin of actinopterygians, pronation is imitated by a more prominent flexion of preaxial rays than of postaxial ones, bringing the flexor side of the fin web downwards to face the ground.

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2019a</xref>). The second option for repositioning the actinopterygian pectoral fin on the ground as well includes 90&#176; pronation, but with additional abduction of fins from the body flank and their curving in a preaxial direction (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0007"
            ref-type="fig"
          >7j</xref>). As a result, the pectoral fin still touches the ground with its flexor side, but in this case with distal end turned anteriorly. Positioning of the preaxial edge of the fin changes from dorsal, in the proximal part, to medial, at the end. This option is used for underwater walking by antennariid frogfishes (Edwards <xref

Furthermore, instead of the flexor side, the extensor side does touch the ground&#8212;an exact opposite of the situation in tetrapod forelimbs and pectoral fins of frogfishes, <italic

          >Based on the analysis of video recordings of modern terrestrial fishes presented above, it is possible to formulate basic principles of fish walking which can be performed without special structural adaptations of locomotor apparatus. As was mentioned above, the types of fish walking are not discrete. Their continuum ranges from sidewinding of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Monopterus</italic> on one end to jumping of mudskipper on the other, with various gradations of walking in between. The distinctive feature of sidewinding is that points of support are not tied to any specific organs (appendages), but move along the ventral side of the body from nose to tail during the locomotor cycle. (Contrary to sidewinding, in serpentine crawling, the ventral surface of the body is nowhere elevated above the ground, which makes serpentine crawling incomparable to legged walking). On the other end, the distinctive feature of jumping is that the mechanical work of muscles is mainly done to overcome the vertical force of gravity when the body is propelled upwards. Therefore, locomotion of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Anabas</italic>, moving on its flank, approaches jumping since in that position lateral bending of the body results in inevitable significant rises and falls of the center of mass above the ground during each locomotor cycle. This could be classified as jumping without an unsupported ballistic stage. In fact, that stage is sometimes observed in <italic

          >Clarias</italic> could be considered an intermediate between walking and jumping. Its step starts with straightening of the body in the plane of substrate, like in case of walking in <italic

          >The main principle of terrestrial walking is the unequal distribution of weight between supporting organs and the rest lower surface of the body. The latter either touches the ground but lightly or is elevated and, therefore, moves along the ground with reduced friction or no friction at all, respectively. Video recordings of walking fishes show that one point of support (e.g. chin, operculum, pectoral fin) is placed in front of the center of mass of the body, and another (e.g. anal fin, tail) behind it. The part of the body situated between them is held suspended. From this simple principle, we are going to develop a calculation for maximum size of a fish that would be potentially able to walk out of water. An ideal walking condition is that a fish can hold its body as a bridge supported at both ends and with at least a small clearance in the middle. For this, supporting organs and spine should be able to withstand full weight of the body out of water not breaking and not sagging to the ground. The ability to hold a force is limited by cross&#8208;sectional areas of muscles and skeletal elements, while the weight of the body is proportional to its volume. Therefore, with an isometric increase of fish size, its weight grows to the power of 1.5 of the cross&#8208;sectional area of any muscle or bone. Consequently, there should exist some large size when cross&#8208;sectional areas of some muscles or/and skeletal elements are no longer sufficient to withstand the body weight. At this theoretical value of body size, that we are going to calculate, the belly will lay down on the ground and thus the main prerequisite for terrestrial walking will be lost. Fishes larger than this size should be non&#8208;walking out of water in principle, whether they can breathe air or not.</p>

In particular, there is no allometric change of proportions which could enhance counter&#8208;gravitational abilities of locomotorium with the growth of the body size. Under this condition, the abstract fishes of different sizes remain isometric to each other. Remember almost isometric length&#8208;mass growth of <italic

          >Turn now to the larger fish B. For simplicity, it is convenient to make 2 additional assumptions in this branch of analysis. The first assumption is homogeneous density all over the fish body and its equality to the density of water. In reality, tetrapodomorphs were significantly heterogeneous in their density, at least in that their lungs were placed closer to the ventral side as manifested by the fact that they (e.g. <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Panderichthys</italic>) were usually buried belly up. As for the average density, it is indeed close to that of water in vertebrates: Their body has approximately neutral buoyancy, that is, it weighs almost nothing when submerged. The second assumption is that the body of the fish B has the same area <italic

          >2013</xref>), that size limits for a jumping fish are associated with the problem of body weight increasing to the power of 1.5 relative to available muscle force. A method for calculating a theoretical maximum size of a jumping fish was not suggested in the cited research, and we too will not concentrate on it. To achieve the goal of our current analysis, it is enough to base all further reasoning on a reasonable supposition that the largest jumping fish is still smaller than the largest walking fish. Indeed, the jumping giant mudskipper <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Periophthalmodon schlosseri</italic> is a little under 30 cm in length (Mazlan &amp; Rohaya <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0040"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >2008</xref>), while <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>, the largest fish with documented walking, was 70 cm in length (Bressman <italic

          >et&#160;al</italic>. <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0010"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >2019a</xref>). Such difference is quite understandable: In walking, the gravitational load is balanced by a static muscular effort to support the belly clear off the ground; while in jumping, much mechanical work is done against the force of gravity. Thus, a static model is not enough for jumping. We need to take into account the mechanical work performed by muscles during the time interval when the body is pushed up from the ground. After the launch moment, throughout unsupported ballistic movement, the previously produced muscular work is represented by the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the body which are partly or entirely (in the vertical jump with negligible air resistance) converted one into another, and back again. Let us consider the highest vertical jump, the fish C could execute. This type of jumps is called thrashes (Gibb <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >et&#160;al</italic>. <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0028"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >2013</xref>). The height of this jump <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>
<sub
          >C</sub> is a distance that the common center of mass of the fish travels from its initial position, belly down on the ground, to its topmost position in the air. In that topmost aerial position, all mechanical energy of the body relative to the ground is present in potential form and can be written down as <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >m</italic>
<sub>C</sub>
<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">H</italic>
<sub
          >C</sub>. This energy has been added to the body during the push&#8208;up interval, starting from the initial position when the belly was on the ground, and ending at the launch position when supporting organs (for example the tail) lose contact with the ground. The push&#8208;up distance&#8212;let us call it <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >h</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">'</italic>
<sub
          >C</sub>&#8212;is the vertical displacement of the common center of mass of the body between these 2 positions. By multiplying this distance by a push&#8208;up force produced due to muscular contraction, we will get the mechanical work which will be entirely converted into the potential energy of the body at the top of the thrash. We already have a general formula for the available force of support, and written for fish C it looks like <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >k</italic>
<italic toggle="yes">S</italic>
<sub
          >C</sub>. However, this formula represents the maximum force produced by muscles in a static state, the so&#8208;called isometric contraction, without shortening. When a muscle is actively shortening, its force is reduced inversely proportional to the shortening speed. As a result, when a muscle is required to shorten and develop maximum power, as in case of jumping, its force is inevitably reduced to about &#8531; (around 0.3 according to Hill <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0032"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >1938</xref>) of the force value in isometric contraction. The factor of force reduction could have a different value if fishes employed elastic energy storage when jumping (Gibb <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >et al</italic>. <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0028"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >2013</xref>). However, more advanced models show that elastic energy storage loses its benefits for jumping if the animal weight exceeds several grams (Sutton <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >et al</italic>. <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0056"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >2019</xref>). Since jumping fishes that are of interest to us are at the very least 10 times heavier than several grams, we can reasonably use the &#8531; factor of force reduction at powerful shortening as compared to the maximum force value at isometric contraction. Based on the foregoing we can write down the next equation describing mechanical work at push&#8208;up and potential energy at the topmost position in the vertical jump of the fish C:

During one stage of locomotor cycle, it lies belly&#8208;down on the ground and straightens its body in&#160;the horizontal plane, but in the next stage, it stands on the pectoral fin spine flank&#8208;down and bends the body in the vertical plane. However, in intrinsic coordinates of the body, these straightening and bending occur in the same morphological plane known as the frontal plane: they are the lateral extension and the lateral flexion, respectively. That type of 3&#8208;D movement was most likely unavailable to tetrapodomorph fishes not only because they did not have a pectoral spine to stand on, but also because their body was completely armored with thick scales restricting body deformations. Skin of <italic

          >Clarias</italic> is bare and the body is pliable both with respect to bending and to axial torsion, which is necessary for rolling from belly to the flank. Furthermore, tetrapodomorph fishes, being about a meter in length, were too heavy to roll their body from side to side and raise it high above the ground by bending in an arc twice during every locomotor cycle, in the left&#8208;flank&#8208;down and the right&#8208;flank&#8208;down positions.

However, the cited paper only provides video recordings made from above which do not allow to define which body parts are anchored to the ground at the moment of body straightening&#8212;the anal fin (less developed than in <italic

          <p>By opposition with <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>, it is easy to guess what organ could take on the metalocomotor propulsive role in tetrapodomorph fishes. In <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>, the anal fin is a prominent structure. It extends along the abdomen anteriorly up to the middle of the body length or even more cranially, to the level where the common center of mass of the body is located. At the anterior termination of the anal fin, there are the structures which were displaced anteriorly together with it&#8212;the anus and the pelvic fins. The latter are considerably reduced. It is quite possible that in the course of evolution of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>, a choice of a metalocomotor propulsor has been made in favor of the anal fin because the pelvic fins are always underdeveloped in teleosts (there is no endoskeleton in the fin lobe). Contrary to that, in tetrapodomorph fishes, the pelvic fins had typically a stronger endoskeleton in the fin lobe than the anal fin and this was a decisive condition why they &#8220;won the prize&#8221; of becoming the metalocomotor propulsor at the very start of water&#8208;land transition in Devonian. In this group, the anal fin became not a propulsor but hindrance on land. It was still retained in <italic

          >Elpistostege</italic> but completely lost in <italic

          <p
          >From a general point of view, a question should be asked: what would happen in the evolution of propulsors if all fins were initially equally strong? Is the pelvic or the anal fin more suitable for metalocomotor propulsion in this abstract case? It is noteworthy how sharply <italic

          >Channa</italic> bends its body sideways before each metalocomotor push (Fig.&#160;<xref

            ref-type="fig"

Apparently, this is necessary for the best positioning of the anal fin anchoring point relative to the pectoral fin of the convex flank, as that pectoral fin is going to become a fulcrum around which the body will rotate during the metalocomotor push. We have already mentioned that our earlier measurements of overlaps between rhomboid scale rows of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Panderichthys</italic> allowed to calculate that the glenoacetabular body region of tetrapodomorph fishes could bend laterally in an arc of about 60&#176; (Vorobyeva &amp; Kuznetsov <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >1992</xref>). This flexibility is considerably smaller than in <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>. On the other hand, as the study of a discovered pelvis of <italic

            ref-type="bibr"

          >Tiktaalik</italic> (Shubin <italic

            ref-type="bibr"

          >Panderichthys</italic> (Boisvert <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2005</xref>), but it seems safe enough to assume that its pelvic fin could be abducted to approximately the same angle. The profit of the pelvic fin abduction is quite obvious within the framework of metalocomotor propulsion. Unlike the anal fin of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>, the abductive pelvic fin can be displaced to the side without bending of the body (Fig.&#160;<xref

            ref-type="fig"
          >7l</xref>). Thus, tetrapodomorphs could carry out the metalocomotor anchoring point laterally not only by bending the body, but also by abducting the pelvic fin further away. Although the pelvic fin of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Panderichthys</italic> was still relatively small, it was strongly built (Boisvert <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2005</xref>) and, hence, could serve as a reliable propulsor. For efficient anchoring to the substrate, the pelvic fin should be placed on the ground with its stiff preaxial edge, not with the wide flexor (plantar) surface. Therefore, the initial posture on land of the pelvic and pectoral fins of tetrapodomorphs could be quite different (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0007"
            ref-type="fig"
          >7l</xref>). The pectoral fin in a supporting position could be placed along the flank with its flexor side on the ground (as reconstructed for <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Panderichthys</italic> by Vorobyeva and Kuznetsov <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >1992</xref>), but the pelvic fin in a propulsive position could be abducted at about 45&#176; to the flank with its preaxial edge on the ground and flexor side facing posteromedially. This type of initial limb placement was not previously considered for tetrapodomorphs (Shubin <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0053"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >1995</xref>). However, it appears to be not only quite a possible posture, based on available fossils, but also the most practical one for interaction with such a difficult substrate as wet clay. The pectoral fin, placed on the ground with its wide flexor surface, provides adequate support for the massive anterior part of the body&#8212;it does not sink into the substrate and allows the body to easily turn around on it during the metalocomotor push. The pelvic fin, in turn, inserts into clay with its preaxial edge for efficient push. The preaxial fin edge in most fishes is equipped with either a spine or thickened lepidotrichii. Tetrapodomorph fishes, including <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Tiktaalik</italic>, are not an exception (Shubin <italic
            toggle="yes"

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2014</xref>). During aquatic locomotion, the reinforcement of lepidotrichii of the preaxial edge is justified by the fact that it is a leading edge of the fin, the first to encounter oncoming water flow. On land, strong preaxial lepidotrichii as well as the downward orientation of this edge of the pelvic fin became a crucial adaptation for tetrapodomorphs, allowing them to firmly anchor the fin on substrate and transmit propulsive force to the body. <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Ichthyostega</italic> retains rather obvious although overlooked features manifesting the use of this kind of hind limb anchoring. First, due to the inclination of the unusually elongate acetabulum, its hind limb's preaxial edge faces anteroventrally, towards the substrate (Fig.&#160;<xref
            rid="inz212599-fig-0007"
            ref-type="fig"
          >7m</xref>). Second, this edge is unusually reinforced. The first 3 digits, although they are individually weaker than the next 4, are tightly packed together forming a strong syndactyl unit, a kind of superhallux. In addition, preaxial to them, the tibia is overbuilt with an enigmatic &#8220;poorly ossified mass&#8221; (Coates &amp; Clack <xref

          <p
          >The metalocomotor walking technique hypothesized herein for tetrapodomorph fishes implies coupling of the action of the pectoral fin as support and the pelvic fin as propulsor. The step would start from the laterally bent pose. From this pose, the fish would push itself forward by straightening the body due to synchronous contraction of myomeres in the glenoacetabular region on the convex flank. To transfer body straightening into forward progression most efficiently, the fish should properly choose 1 of the 2 pectoral fins for support and 1 of the 2 pelvic fins for propulsion. In each pair, the proper fin is that one which, at the beginning of the step, is found on the anteriorly facing flank. In the C&#8208;like curved body, it is the pectoral fin on the convex side and the pelvic fin on the concave side. The latter is contralateral to the former (Fig.&#160;<xref

The trace of propulsor is interrupted: anchoring pits alternate with swings over the air. Therefore, with metalocomotor propulsor, the tail would tend to move over the air (like it does in <italic

          >Channa</italic>), and with prolocomotor propulsor, the tail would move more independently tending to be dragged along the ground continuously (like in <italic

The true direction could be only found out by means of thorough analysis of depth profile of the pits. I would suggest that the posterior edge of the pelvic fin pits (pale blue on Fig.&#160;<xref

          >Acanthostega</italic>, the hind limb is already longer than the forelimb and the pes is larger than the manus (Coates <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >1996</xref>). Second, there are no digits on the trackway under consideration. The digits' impressions on some isolated imprints from Zache&#322;mie (e.g. Muz. PGI 1728.II.1) are a misinterpretation in my opinion (see my arguments in Introduction). Third, the time of formation of Zache&#322;mie trackway field was the time of existence of tetrapodomorph fishes, not yet tetrapods themselves (Ahlberg <xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2019</xref>). Thus, the &#8220;fish hypothesis&#8221; for Zache&#322;mie suggested herein explains it more parsimoniously, without assuming a period of ghost existence of early tetrapods as, in fact, suggested by Ahlberg (<xref

            ref-type="bibr"

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2014</xref>), which indicates a significant development of muscles of the hip joint. A large surface area of the ventral plate (pubis) of the pelvis in <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Tiktaalik</italic> implies a significant cross&#8208;sectional area and, therefore, a significant force of ventral hip muscles. They were able to press the pelvic fin forcibly down to the substrate and, thus, take on the weight of the posterior part of the body and suspend it over the ground just a little, which is a necessary condition for walking. However, for a propulsive organ, the most crucial muscles are retractors which pull it posteriorly. In this case, the retractors are represented by adductors, which pull the pelvic fin back to the side of the tail from abducted position. In tetrapods, these muscles mainly come to the thigh from the posterior pelvic bone, the ischium. However, there is yet no such bone in <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Tiktaalik</italic> (in tetrapods, it was probably added by recruitment of basal scute from the dermal skeleton (Panchen &amp; Smithson <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0044"
            ref-type="bibr"
          >1990</xref>)). The required retractor of the pelvic fin could come from the tail as a predecessor of caudofemoralis muscle of tetrapods. According to the general law that the muscular force is greater in isometric contraction and decreases inversely proportional to the shortening speed, the pelvic fin retractor should develop greater force while statically holding the fin in place and smaller force when actively adducting it. The other law, which was used above for the calculation of the size limit for a walking fish is that with isometric growth of a body (not to be confused with the isometric contraction of muscle), its volume and mass increase as a power of 1.5 of the areas of its surfaces and cross&#8208;sections. In turn, the body mass directly determines the magnitude of the sliding friction force experienced by the parts of the fish body which fail to be raised above the substrate but are being dragged in contact with it. On the other hand, the available force of a muscle is directly determined by its cross&#8208;sectional area (more specifically, the physiological cross&#8208;sectional area which is calculated as a ratio of muscle volume to the mean length of muscle fibers). Therefore, it can be assumed that for larger specimens of tetrapodomorph fish the isometric contraction of retractors of the pelvic fin was barely enough to develop the propulsive force to overcome sliding friction of the belly being dragged along the substrate. The muscular effort could be aided with posterior ligaments of the hip joint capsule which stop abduction (protraction) of the femur beyond the limit of about 45&#176;. In this case, the pelvic fin is held in a static position relative to the body acting as a passive propulsor, while all mechanical work against forces of friction is performed by the axial muscles of the trunk. In smaller specimens of that same tetrapodomorph fish, the retractor muscles of the pelvic fin could have an excess force being sufficient to come out of static contraction, actively shorten and retract the fin. In this case, the pelvic fin retractors were involved in mechanical work production along with the axial muscles. In the smaller individual of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Ch. striata</italic>, a similar propulsive motion was noticed in the pectoral fins. The difference is that, in the latter case, the additional mechanical work came from prolocomotor elements to otherwise metalocomotor system, while what is supposed in tetrapodomorph fishes is no more than a redistribution of mechanical work within the metalocomotor system. As a result, at earlier stages of individual growth, tetrapodomorph fishes could have tried active involvement of hind limbs in terrestrial locomotion, a trait that, later in evolution, was fixed in adult tetrapods due to further strengthening of hind limb muscles.</p>
          <p
          >The proposed action of the pelvic fin of tetrapodomorphs in an abducted position clarifies a previously baffling fact that, after transition from water to land, hind limbs have quickly surpassed the forelimbs in length, although before that transition, they were always shorter. For example, in <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Tulerpeton</italic>, a Devonian tetrapod with the most completely preserved fore and hind limbs of a single individual, the hind limb was already 10% longer than the forelimb (measured on the drawings from Lebedev &amp; Coates <xref

            toggle="yes"
          >Channa</italic>&#8208;type metalocomotor walking. It is quite obvious that swinging a massive tail is more energy&#8208;wasteful than abducting a relatively light pelvic limb instead. Therefore, a rapid, on the evolutionary time scale, hypertrophy of the pelvic limbs relative to pectoral ones can be explained by the involvement of the former as a partial substitute for energy&#8208;wasteful body bending. In our opinion, there is no ground to infer that &#8220;hindlimb function might lag behind forelimb function across the water&#8211;land transition&#8221; (Pierce <italic

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2013</xref>). The opposite scenario is more likely. The pelvic fins were involved as main propulsors immediately when the first tetrapodomorph fish came out onto dry land, whatever was its reason. It is worth noting that the body size of <italic

          <p
          >Optimization of metalocomotor walking technique could be achieved not only through elongation of the pelvic fins, but also through reorientation of pectoral fins from the position with the distal end pointing posteriorly to the position with the distal end turned anteriorly. As was shown above, this is what makes a contrast between a &#8220;bad walker&#8221; <italic

            toggle="yes"
          >Ch. striata</italic>. In the former, the pectoral fin is pointing posteriorly and is put on the ground with its flexor side; in the latter, it is pointing anteriorly and is landed with the extensor side down. This reorientation is achieved through the fin web flexion, which is the flexion in the strict anatomical sense. In tetrapodomorphs, reorientation of the pectoral fin from the position of <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Panderichthys</italic> to the position of tetrapods had clearly happened without changing the side to land on: it was always the flexor side. This type of reorientation is achieved in a different way than in <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Ch. striata</italic>&#8212;not through flexion of the fin, but by curving longitudinal axis of the fin in a preaxial direction. This is a deformation suggested by Westoll (<xref

            ref-type="bibr"
          >1943</xref>). Indeed, all Devonian tetrapods demonstrate preaxially directed curvature of the forelimb in the elbow (Fig.&#160;<xref

            toggle="yes"
          >Tulerpeton</italic>, they will be found at almost 90&#176; to each other (personal observation). In <italic
            toggle="yes"
          >Panderichthys</italic>, the respective angle in the fin plane between the humerus and the lower fin is also less than 180&#176;. Based on different reconstructions, it is about 165&#176; (Vorobyeva &amp; Kuznetsov <xref
            rid="inz212599-bib-0059"

            ref-type="bibr"
          >2008</xref>). This angle is formed due to slanting of the distal end of the humerus, which results in the condyle for the radius being displaced proximally relative to the condyle for the ulna. There is no such curvature of the longitudinal limb axis in the knee of the hind limb. To sum up, in lower tetrapods, the hind limb is longer and straighter, while the forelimb is shorter and curved at the elbow. This contrasting shape of the 2 limbs is retained up to this day in urodelans. It could be considered as a pinnacle of optimization of <italic

          >Note that Gray was talking about the (left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind etc.) sequence, which he proved to be the only one which ensures uninterrupted static equilibrium for a quadrupedal animal. He termed it &#8220;the diagonal sequence&#8221; because after every forelimb, the contralateral hind limb goes. Later, Hildebrand renamed it into &#8220;the lateral sequence&#8221; because he began to count it from the hind limb after which the ipsilateral forelimb goes: (right hind, right fore, left hind, left fore etc.).

          >sensu</italic> Hildebrand. Gray proved it to be statically unstable. Therefore, among extant tetrapods, it is only found in some (arboreal) mammals, but never in sprawling tetrapods. However, the static equilibrium is not an actual problem in walking fishes due to the fact that their body is laid down on the ground after every half of a walking cycle.</p>
