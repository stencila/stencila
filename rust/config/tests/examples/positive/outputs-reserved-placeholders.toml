# Output configurations with reserved placeholders
# Reserved placeholders ({tag}, {branch}) are auto-bound from git refs
# and don't require matching arguments

[outputs]
# {branch} is reserved - auto-bound from current branch
"builds/{branch}/report.pdf" = { source = "report.md", command = "render" }

# {tag} is reserved - auto-bound from tag when on a tag
"releases/{tag}/report.pdf" = { source = "report.md", command = "render", refs = ["v*"] }

# Mix of reserved and regular placeholders
"releases/{tag}/{region}/report.pdf" = { source = "report.md", command = "render", refs = ["v*"], arguments = { region = ["us", "eu"] } }
