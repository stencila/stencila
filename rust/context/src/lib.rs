/// - Lists of nodes of various types. Intended to be used by specialized assistants
///   that insert or edit nodes of those types to be able to provide examples
///   in their prompts.
///
/// - The `kernels` property which provides information about the state of
///   the document's execution kernels. Intended for use in specialized
///   assistants for `CodeChunk` and `CodeExpression` nodes to help improve
///   the accuracy of generated code.
