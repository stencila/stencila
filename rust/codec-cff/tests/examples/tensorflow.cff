title: TensorFlow, Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems
abstract: >-
  TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale
  and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to
  represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate
  that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines
  in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices,
  including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs
  known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility
  to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs
  the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables
  developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms.
  TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong
  support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google
  services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source
  project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research.
