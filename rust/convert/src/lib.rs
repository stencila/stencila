//! Utility function for conversion between formats
//!
//! This crate provides one-way conversion between pairs of formats. It is used
//! internally only. It does not use the Stencila Schema as an intermediate
//! representation of documents as do the `Codec` implementations and leans
//! heavily on external tools.
